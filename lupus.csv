1;Academic outcomes in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus.;2012;Arthritis care & research;Zelko F;OBJECTIVE: To explore academic outcomes in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) and their relationship to variables such as demographic and  socioeconomic status, neurocognitive functioning, behavioral/emotional adjustment, and cSLE disease status. METHODS: Forty pairs of children diagnosed with cSLE and healthy best friend controls were rated by parents on a standardized scale of school competence. Information about participants' demographic and socioeconomic status was obtained, along with measures of cSLE disease activity and damage. All of the participants received formal neurocognitive testing and were also rated on standardized scales of behavioral/emotional adjustment and executive functioning. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, school competence was rated as lower in the cSLE group, although the groups did not differ significantly on indices of cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or executive functioning. School competence ratings were correlated with reading and mathematics achievement test scores in both groups, and with ratings of mental self-regulation in the cSLE group. School competence ratings were correlated with measures of cSLE disease activity and treatment intensity. CONCLUSION: cSLE is associated with inferior parent-rated academic outcomes compared to those noted in demographically-matched peers, despite similar neurocognitive function. The adverse academic outcomes that distinguish children with cSLE from their demographically-matched peers appear to be mediated by SLE disease activity and treatment.;2010-2012
2;The -2518 A/G polymorphism in the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 gene is associated with the risk of developing systemic lupus erythematosus in Argentinean patients: a multicenter study.;2012;European cytokine network;Aranda F;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic, autoimmune disorder. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), a chemokine involved in the recruitment and migration of monocytes/macrophages, has been shown to be increased in the plasma  of SLE patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the possible association of the polymorphism -2518 of the MCP-1 gene with the risk of developing SLE, manifesting lupus nephritis (LN) and with other clinical features of SLE in an Argentinean population. A group of 171 SLE patients and 120 control subjects were examined. Genotypic and allelic frequencies of the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphism showed significant differences between the SLE and the control groups (p=0.001 and p=0.01, respectively). However, the polymorphism showed no association with LN or with the other clinical variables studied. Our results suggest that the presence of the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphism might be a risk factor for developing SLE in genetically predisposed individuals, but it does not seem to have a role in the evolution of the disease in the Argentinean population.;2010-2012
3;Using exercise training to counterbalance chronotropic incompetence and delayed heart rate recovery in systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomized trial.;2012;Arthritis care & research;Miossi R;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a 3-month exercise training program in counteracting the chronotropic incompetence and delayed heart rate recovery in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A 12-week randomized trial was conducted. Twenty-four inactive SLE patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups: trained (T; n = 15, 3-month exercise program) and nontrained (NT;  n = 13). A sex-, body mass index-, and age-matched healthy control (C) group (n = 8) also underwent the exercise program. Subjects were assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks after training. Main measurements included the chronotropic reserve (CR) and the heart rate (HR) recovery (DeltaHRR) as defined by the difference between  HR at peak exercise and at both the first (DeltaHRR1) and second (DeltaHRR2) minutes after the exercise test. RESULTS: Neither the NT SLE patients nor the C group presented any change in the CR or in DeltaHRR1 and DeltaHRR2 (P > 0.05). The exercise training program was effective in promoting significant increases in CR (P = 0.007, effect size [ES] 1.15) and in DeltaHRR1 and DeltaHRR2 (P = 0.009,  ES 1.12 and P = 0.002, ES 1.11, respectively) in the SLE T group when compared with the NT group. Moreover, the HR response in SLE patients after training achieved parameters comparable to the C group, as evidenced by the analysis of variance and by the Z score analysis (P > 0.05, T versus C). Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index scores remained stable throughout the study. CONCLUSION: A 3-month exercise training program was safe and capable of reducing  the chronotropic incompetence and the delayed DeltaHRR observed in physically inactive SLE patients.";2010-2012
4;QT dispersion in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: the impact of disease activity.;2012;BMC cardiovascular disorders;Kojuri J;"BACKGROUND: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although autopsy studies have documented  that the heart is affected in most SLE patients, clinical manifestations occur in less than 10%. QT dispersion is a new parameter that can be used to assess homogeneity of cardiac repolarization and autonomic function. We compared the increase in QT dispersion in SLE patients with high disease activity and mild or  moderate disease activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four patients  with SLE were enrolled in the study. Complete history and physical exam, ECG, echocardiography, exercise test and SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) were recorded. Twenty patients were excluded on the basis of our exclusion criteria. The patients were divided to two groups based on SLEDAI: 54 in the high-score group (SLEDAI > 10) and 50 in the low-score group (SLEDAI < 10).QT dispersion was significantly higher in high-score group (58.31 +/- 18.66 vs. 47.90 +/- 17.41 respectively; P < 0.004). QT dispersion was not significantly higher in patients  who had received hydroxychloroquine (54.17 +/- 19.36 vs. 50.82 +/- 15.96, P = 0.45) or corticosteroids (53.58 +/- 19.16 vs. 50.40 + 11.59, P = 0.47). There was a statistically significant correlation between abnormal echocardiographic findings (abnormalities of pericardial effusion, pericarditis, pulmonary hypertension and Libman-Sacks endocarditis) and SLEADI (P < 0.004). CONCLUSIONS:  QT dispersion can be a useful, simple noninvasive method for the early detection  of cardiac involvement in SLE patients with active disease. Concerning high chance of cardiac involvement, cardiovascular evaluation for every SLE patient with a SLEDAI higher than 10 may be recommended.

5;HMOX1 promoter (GT)n polymorphim is associated with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus but not with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in a Mexican population.;2012;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Cordova EJ;"OBJECTIVES: The heme oxigenase 1 (HO-1), a rate-limiting enzyme for heme degradation, is an important cytoprotective protein. Transcriptional activity of  HO-1 coding gene (HMOX1) can be regulated by the presence of a dinucleotide repeat polymorphism (GT)n at its promoter region. Accordingly, length of (GT)n repeat has been associated with susceptibility to several diseases. We investigated whether the HMOX1 (GT)n polymorphism was associated with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) susceptibility. METHODS: We studied 207 and 333 unrelated Mexican patients with JRA and childhood-onset SLE, respectively. The control population consisted of 653 individuals ethnically matched with cases. The HMOX1 (GT)n polymorphism was genotype by PCR and fluorescence technology. RESULTS: We found 27 different alleles, with the 22 and 29 repeats as the most common alleles. Distribution of short allele (n<25) and SS genotype was not statistically associated with JRA subjects. Interestingly, the frequency of both short allele and SS genotype was significantly associated with SLE susceptibility (OR=1.47, 95%CI [1.14-1.89], p=0.002; and OR=2.79, 95%CI [1.24-6.24], p=0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The distribution pattern of HMOX1 (GT) alleles was different in the Mexican population than those reported elsewhere. Our results suggest that HMOX1 (GT)n polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to childhood-onset SLE but not with JRA in Mexican individuals.";2010-2012
6;Belimumab in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus: high disease activity predictors of response.;2012;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;van Vollenhoven RF;"OBJECTIVES: To identify factors that predict response to belimumab treatment in the phase 3 BLISS trials of autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and further analyse clinical efficacy in various patient subsets. METHODS:  The BLISS trials compared belimumab 1 and 10 mg/kg versus placebo, all plus standard SLE therapy, over 52 or 76 weeks. Pooled subgroup analyses of week 52 SLE responder index rates (the primary endpoint in both trials) were performed based on demographic characteristics and baseline disease activity indicators. Pooled multivariate analysis was performed to determine predictors of response and treatment effect. RESULTS: Pooled univariate and multivariate analyses (N=1684) identified baseline factors associated with an increased benefit of belimumab versus placebo. These factors included the Safety Of Estrogens In Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) >/=10, low complement, anti-dsDNA positivity and corticosteroid use. Efficacy outcomes were assessed in the low complement/anti-dsDNA-positive and SELENA-SLEDAI >/=10 subgroups. Week 52 SLE Responder Index rates in the low complement/anti-dsDNA-positive subgroup were 31.7%, 41.5% (p=0.002) and 51.5% (p<0.001) with placebo and belimumab 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively; corresponding rates in the SELENA-SLEDAI >/=10 subgroup were 44.3%, 58.0% (p<0.001) and 63.2% (p<0.001). Further analysis of secondary endpoints in the low complement/anti-dsDNA-positive subgroup showed that compared with placebo, belimumab produced greater benefits regarding severe flares, corticosteroid use and health-related quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that belimumab has greater therapeutic benefit than standard therapy alone in patients with higher disease activity, anti-dsDNA positivity, low complement or corticosteroid treatment at baseline.

7;Efficacy and safety of methotrexate in articular and cutaneous manifestations of  systemic lupus erythematosus.;2012;International journal of rheumatic diseases;Islam MN;AIM: A prospective open-label study comparing the efficacy and safety of methotrexate (MTX) and chloroquine (CQ) in articular and cutaneous manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Consecutive SLE patients were randomly assigned to either 10 mg MTX weekly or 150 mg CQ daily during 24 weeks.  Outcome measures were: numbers of swollen and tender joints, duration of morning  stiffness, visual analog scale (VAS) for articular pain, physician global assessment index, patient global assessment index, SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), disappearance of skin rash and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). RESULTS: Forty-one patients consented to participate, 15 were allocated in the MTX group and 26 in the CQ group. Two patients on MTX dropped out due to side-effects and two in the CQ group, one due to side-effects and one due to inefficacy. Baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters of the two groups were nearly identical. In both groups the clinical and laboratory parameters improved significantly over 24 weeks, except the ESR in the MTX group. The results of the outcome measures at the end of the trial did not differ significantly between the two groups, except morning stiffness (P < 0.05 in favor of the MTX group) and ESR (P < 0.01 in favor of the CQ group). Rise of serum alanine aminotransferase was observed in two cases in the MTX group and in none in the CQ group. CONCLUSION: Low-dose MTX appears to be as effective as CQ in patients with articular and cutaneous manifestations of SLE, having an acceptable toxicity profile. Results of this prospective study need to be confirmed in a larger study.;2010-2012
8;Vitamin D levels: its relationship to bone mineral density response and disease activity in premenopausal Malaysian systemic lupus erythematosus patients on corticosteroids.;2012;International journal of rheumatic diseases;Yeap SS;AIM: To determine if baseline vitamin D levels would influence the gain in bone mineral density (BMD) in female systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients on corticosteroids (CS) taking bone-active medication. METHOD: Premenopausal SLE patients participating in a trial assessing the efficacy of calcium alone, calcitriol and calcium, and alendronate and calcium, on BMD in patients on CS, were studied. Patients were randomly allocated to the treatment groups at the start of the study and followed up for 2 years. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] was measured at baseline. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were studied.  One (2%) patient had osteoporosis, nine (24%) had osteopenia and all others had normal BMD. The mean baseline 25(OH)D levels were 21.6 +/- 4.6 ng/mL (+/- 1 SD).  Twelve (32%) patients had vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL]. There was a  significant negative correlation between SLEDAI scores and 25(OH)D levels, that is, patients with high SLEDAI scores had significantly lower 25(OH)D levels (P =  0.033). Left femoral neck BMD was significantly lower in the deficient compared to insufficient group (P = 0.042). There was a trend toward better BMD gain at 2  years in the vitamin D insufficient compared to the deficient group, which did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: This study showed that in female  SLE patients, low vitamin D levels are associated with higher disease activity and suggests that patients who have higher vitamin D levels have a better BMD response during treatment with bone-active agents.;2010-2012
9;Weight loss and improvements in fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus: a controlled trial of a low glycaemic index diet versus a calorie restricted diet in patients treated with corticosteroids.;2012;Lupus;Davies RJ;"BACKGROUND: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may require prolonged periods of corticosteroid therapy which lead to excessive weight gain and increased cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of a low glycaemic index diet in patients with corticosteroid dependent SLE in achieving weight loss and improving glycaemic control. DESIGN: A total of 23 women were enrolled in a 6 week study. All had mild, stable SLE, were receiving corticosteroids and had a body mass index > 25 kg/m(2). Subjects were randomly assigned to a low glycaemic index (Low GI) diet or a calorie restricted (Low Cal) diet. The primary end point was weight loss. Secondary end points included tolerability of diet, bio-markers of cardiovascular risk, disease activity, fatigue and sleep quality. RESULTS: Weight loss in both treatment groups was significant (mean +/- SD: Low GI diet 3.9 +/- 0.9 kg; Low Cal diet 2.4 +/- 2.2 kg, p < 0.01 from baseline in each group). There were also significant improvements in waist and hip measurements. However, the difference in weight loss and waist and hip measurements between the two diet groups was not statistically significant. There was a statistically significant reduction in Fatigue Severity Scale in both diet groups, (p < 0.03). Both Low GI and Low Cal diets were well tolerated, resulting in no serious adverse effects or increase in disease activity. CONCLUSION: Significant weight loss is achievable over 6 weeks  in a diet-specific trial in subjects with stable SLE, who are on low dose prednisolone. Both diets were equally tolerable, and did not cause flares in disease activity. Our results suggest that dietary manipulation may significantly improve fatigue in subjects with SLE.";2010-2012
10;Influenza A/H1N1 vaccination of patients with SLE: can antimalarial drugs restore diminished response under immunosuppressive therapy?;2012;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Borba EF;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1)  in SLE under different therapeutic regimens. METHODS: A total of 555 SLE patients and 170 healthy controls were vaccinated with a single dose of a non-adjuvanted preparation. According to current therapy, patients were initially classified as  SLE No Therapy (n = 75) and SLE with Therapy (n = 480). Subsequent evaluations included groups under monotherapy: chloroquine (CQ) (n = 105), prednisone (PRED)  >/=20 mg (n = 76), immunosuppressor (IS) (n = 95) and those with a combination of these drugs. Anti-H1N1 titres and seroconversion (SC) rate were evaluated at entry and 21 days post-vaccination. RESULTS: The SLE with Therapy group had lower SC compared with healthy controls (59.0 vs 80.0%; P < 0.0001), whereas the SLE No Therapy group had equivalent SC (72 vs 80.0%; P = 0.18) compared with healthy controls. Further comparison revealed that the SC of SLE No Therapy (72%) was similar to the CQ group (69.5%; P = 0.75), but it was significantly reduced in PRED >/=20 mg (53.9%; P = 0.028), IS (55.7%; P = 0.035) and PRED >/=20 mg + IS (45.4%; P = 0.038). The concomitant use of CQ in each of these later regimens was associated with SC responses comparable with SLE No Therapy group (72%): PRED >/=20 mg + CQ (71.4%; P = 1.00), IS + CQ (65.2%; P = 0.54) and PRED >/=20 mg + IS + CQ (57.4%; P = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Pandemic influenza A H1N1/2009 vaccine response is diminished in SLE under immunosuppressive therapy and antimalarials seems to restore this immunogenicity.

11;Disease activity, severity, and damage in the UK Juvenile-Onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Cohort.;2012;Arthritis and rheumatism;Watson L;OBJECTIVE: The UK Juvenile-Onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (JSLE) Cohort Study is a multicenter collaborative network established with the aim of improving the  understanding of juvenile SLE. The present study was undertaken to describe the clinical manifestations and disease course in patients with juvenile SLE from this large, national inception cohort. METHODS: Detailed data on clinical phenotype were collected at baseline and at regular clinic reviews and annual followup assessments in 232 patients from 14 centers across the UK over 4.5 years. Patients with SLE were identified according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) SLE classification criteria. The present cohort comprised children with juvenile SLE (n=198) whose diagnosis fulfilled >/=4 of the ACR criteria for SLE. RESULTS: Among patients with juvenile SLE, the female:male sex  distribution was 5.6:1 and the median age at diagnosis was 12.6 years (interquartile range 10.4-14.5 years). Male patients were younger than female patients (P<0.01). Standardized ethnicity data demonstrated a greater risk of juvenile SLE in non-Caucasian UK patients (P<0.05). Scores on the pediatric adaptation of the 2004 British Isles Lupus Assessment Group disease activity index demonstrated significantly increased frequencies of musculoskeletal (82%),  renal (80%), hematologic (91%), immunologic (54%), and neurologic (26%) involvement among the patients over time. A large proportion of the patients (93%) were taking steroids and 24% of the patients required treatment with cyclophosphamide. Disease damage was common, with 28% of the patients having a Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/ACR damage score of >/=1. CONCLUSION: The data on these patients from the UK JSLE Cohort Study, comprising  one of the largest national inception cohorts of patients with juvenile SLE to date, indicate that severe organ involvement and significant disease activity are primary characteristics in children with juvenile SLE. In addition, accumulation  of disease-associated damage could be seen.;2010-2012
12;White matter correlates of neuropsychological dysfunction in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2012;PloS one;Jung RE;"Patients diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus have similar levels of neuropsychological dysfunction (i.e., 20-50%) as those with Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (NPSLE). We hypothesized a gradient between cognition and white matter integrity, such that strongest brain-behavior relationships would emerge in NPSLE, intermediate in non-NPSLE, and minimal in controls. We studied thirty-one patients (16 non-NPSLE; 15 NPSLE), ranging in age from 18 to 59 years old (100% female), and eighteen age and gender matched healthy controls. DTI examinations were performed on a 1.5T scanner. A broad neuropsychological battery was administered, tapping attention, memory, processing speed, and executive functioning. The Total z-score consisted of the combined sum of all neuropsychological measures. In control subjects, we found no significant FA-Total z-score correlations. NPSLE, non-NPSLE, and control subjects differed significantly in terms of Total z-score (NPSLE = -2.25+/-1.77, non-NPSLE = -1.22+/-1.03, Controls = -0.10+/-.57; F = 13.2, p<.001). In non-NPSLE subjects, FA within the right external capsule was significantly correlated with Total z-score. In NPSLE subjects, the largest FA-Total z-score clusters were observed within the left anterior thalamic radiation and right superior longitudinal fasciculus. In subsequent analyses the largest number of significant voxels linked FA with the Processing Speed z-score in NPSLE. The current results reflect objective white matter correlates of neuropsychological dysfunction in both NPSLE and (to a lesser degree) in non-NPSLE. non-NPSLE and NPSLE subjects did not differ significantly in terms of depression, as measured by the GDI; thus, previous hypotheses suggesting moderating effects of depression upon neuropsychological performance do not impact the current FA results.";2010-2012
13;Belimumab reduces autoantibodies, normalizes low complement levels, and reduces select B cell populations in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2012;Arthritis and rheumatism;Stohl W;OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of the B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS)-specific inhibitor belimumab on immunologic biomarkers, including B cell and T cell populations, and maintenance of antibody titers to prior vaccines in autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. METHODS: Pooled data from 2 phase III trials, the Study of Belimumab in Subjects with SLE  52-week (BLISS-52) and 76-week (BLISS-76) trials, comparing belimumab 1 mg/kg or  10 mg/kg versus placebo (plus standard SLE therapy for each group) were analyzed  for changes in autoantibody, immunoglobulin, and complement levels. BLISS-76 patients were also analyzed for changes in B cell and T cell populations and effects on prior vaccine-induced antibody levels. RESULTS: Belimumab-treated patients experienced significant sustained reductions in IgG and autoantibodies and improvement in C3/C4 levels, resulting in greater positive-to-negative conversion rates for IgG anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), anti-Sm, anticardiolipin, and anti-ribosomal P autoantibodies and normalization of hypergammaglobulinemia and low C3/C4 levels. Belimumab-treated patients experienced significant decreases in the numbers of naive and activated B cells,  as well as plasma cells, whereas memory B cells and T cell populations did not decrease. Belimumab did not substantially affect preexisting antipneumococcal or  anti-tetanus toxoid antibody levels. Post hoc analysis showed greater reductions  in SLE disease activity and the risk of severe flares in patients treated with belimumab 10 mg/kg (P</=0.01) who were anti-dsDNA positive and had low C3/C4 levels at baseline. Normalization of the C3 or anti-dsDNA level by 8 weeks, irrespective of therapy, was predictive of a reduced risk of severe flare over 52 weeks. CONCLUSION: Belimumab appears to promote normalization of serologic activity and reduce BLyS-dependent B cell subsets in serologically and clinically active SLE. Greater serologic activity may predict a better treatment response to belimumab.;2010-2012
14;Inactive disease and remission in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus.;2012;Arthritis care & research;Mina R;"OBJECTIVE: To define inactive disease (ID) and clinical remission (CR) and to delineate variables that can be used to measure ID/CR in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE). METHODS: Delphi questionnaires were sent to an international group of pediatric rheumatologists. Respondents provided information about variables to be used in future algorithms to measure ID/CR. The usefulness of these variables was assessed in 35 children with ID and 31 children with minimally active lupus (MAL). RESULTS: While ID reflects cSLE status at a specific point in time, CR requires the presence of ID for >6 months and considers treatment. There was consensus that patients in ID/CR can have <2 mild  nonlimiting symptoms (i.e., fatigue, arthralgia, headaches, or myalgia) but not Raynaud's phenomenon, chest pain, or objective physical signs of cSLE; antinuclear antibody positivity and erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevation can  be present. Complete blood count, renal function testing, and complement C3 all must be within the normal range. Based on consensus, only damage-related laboratory or clinical findings of cSLE are permissible with ID. The above parameters were suitable to differentiate children with ID/CR from those with MAL (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve >0.85). Disease activity  scores with or without the physician global assessment of disease activity and patient symptoms were well suited to differentiate children with ID from those with MAL. CONCLUSION: Consensus has been reached on common definitions of ID/CR with cSLE and relevant patient characteristics with ID/CR. Further studies must assess the usefulness of the data-driven candidate criteria for ID in cSLE.";2010-2012
15;cAMP-responsive element modulator alpha (CREMalpha) suppresses IL-17F protein expression in T lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).;2012;The Journal of biological chemistry;Hedrich CM;The proinflammatory cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F are primarily produced by Th17 lymphocytes. Both are involved in host defense mechanisms against bacterial and fungal pathogens and contribute to the development of various autoimmune diseases. T lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) display increased expression of transcription factor cAMP-responsive element modulator alpha (CREMalpha), which has been documented to account for aberrant T  cell function and contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE. Here, we provide evidence that IL-17F expression is reduced in SLE T cells. We demonstrate that CREMalpha binds to a yet unidentified CRE site within the proximal promoter. This results in reduced IL-17F expression in SLE T lymphocytes and is independent of activating epigenetic patterns (increased histone H3 Lys-18 acetylation, reduced  histone H3 Lys-27 trimethylation, and CpG-DNA demethylation). Forced CREMalpha expression in human T lymphocytes results in reduced IL-17F expression. Our findings demonstrate extended involvement of CREMalpha in cytokine dysregulation  in SLE by contributing to a disrupted balance between IL-17A and IL-17F. An increased IL-17A/IL-17F ratio may aggravate the proinflammatory phenotype of SLE.;2010-2012
16;Differences between rheumatologists and other internists regarding diagnosis and  treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.;2012;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Lerang K;"OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostics and treatment of SLE patients in the care  of rheumatologists with patients in the care of other specialities within a geographically complete cohort. METHODS: Nine different sources were used to identify SLE patients resident in Oslo between 1999 and 2008. Only SLE patients fulfilling four or more of the updated 1997 ACR criteria were included. Data were extracted from medical records. The patients were classified into three groups according to each patient's responsible doctor's speciality. RESULTS: A total of  325 SLE patients were included in the study. Of these, 227 had solely been in the care of rheumatologists (rheumatology group), 34 had solely been in the care of nephrologists, haematologists or infectious disease specialists (non-rheumatology group) and 64 had been in the care of both rheumatologists and other specialists  (multidisciplinary group). Even though patients in the non-rheumatology group and multidisciplinary group showed similar disease characteristics, patients in the non-rheumatology group were less often tested for aPLs (68 vs 94%; P = 0.001) and less often treated with HCQ (12 vs 78%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to rheumatologists, non-rheumatologists do not routinely test all SLE patients for aPLs, and rarely prescribe HCQ. These findings indicate that more communication between different specialists caring for SLE is needed, and highlights an area in need of agreement.";2010-2012
17;Pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of paquinimod (ABR-215757), a new quinoline-3-carboxamide derivative: studies in lupus-prone mice and a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat-dose, dose-ranging study in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2012;Arthritis and rheumatism;Bengtsson AA;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of paquinimod, a new immunomodulatory small molecule, in a murine lupus model, and to evaluate its pharmacokinetics and tolerability in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients at doses predicted to be efficacious and safe and determine the maximum tolerated dose. METHODS: The efficacy of paquinimod was studied in lupus-prone MRL-lpr/lpr mice and compared with that of established SLE treatments. Dose-response data and pharmacokinetic data were used to calculate effective and safe clinical doses of paquinimod. The  pharmacokinetics and tolerability of paquinimod were evaluated in a phase Ib double-blind, placebo controlled, dose-ranging study in which cohorts of SLE patients received daily oral treatment for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Paquinimod treatment resulted in disease inhibition in MRL-lpr/lpr mice, comparable to that  obtained with prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil; prominent effects on disease manifestations and serologic markers and a steroid-sparing effect were observed. In patients with SLE, the pharmacokinetic properties of paquinimod were linear and well suitable for once-daily oral treatment. The majority of the adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate, and transient. The most frequent AEs  were arthralgia and myalgia, reported with the highest dose levels of paquinimod  (4.5 mg/day and 6.0 mg/day). At the 4.5 mg/day dose level and higher, some AEs of severe intensity and serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Paquinimod effectively inhibited disease and had a steroid-sparing effect in experimental lupus. Results from preclinical models together with pharmacokinetic data were successfully translated into a safe clinical dose range, and doses of up to 3.0 mg/day were well tolerated in the SLE patients. Taken together, the promising combined data from a murine model and human SLE support the future clinical development of paquinimod.";2010-2012
18;Factors and comorbidities associated with first neuropsychiatric event in systemic lupus erythematosus: does a risk profile exist? A large multicentre retrospective cross-sectional study on 959 Italian patients.;2012;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Govoni M;"OBJECTIVE: To analyse risk factors and comorbidities potentially associated with  CNS involvement in a large cohort of Italian patients affected by SLE. METHODS: A number of generic (not strictly SLE related) and specific (disease related) risk  factors to which all patients have been exposed in the span of 5 years before the first neuropsychiatric (NP) event or before the last available observation were checked for and their distribution was analysed in 959 SLE patients with and without NP involvement; all the first NP events that occurred in a time frame of  10 years were recorded and categorized as SLE related or SLE unrelated. RESULTS:  Three hundred and twenty-six SLE patients with and 633 SLE patients without NP manifestations were included in the study. A total of 469 NP events were recorded. Headache (26.1%), cerebrovascular events (22.7%), mood disorders (8.9%), seizures (14.4%) and cognitive dysfunctions (9.5%) were the most frequent SLE-related NP events. More risk factors [mean 4.52 (2.44) vs 3.73 (2.01); P < 0.0001] were observed in patients with than without NP involvement. Overall, aPLs, LA and APS were factors more strongly associated with NP involvement. CONCLUSIONS: In SLE, NP involvement and aPLs were confirmed as closely related. Furthermore, other modifiable generic risk factors, such as hypertension, carotid vasculopathy and dyslipidaemia, appeared to be related to the occurrence of cerebral vascular accident (CVA) and cognitive dysfunctions, suggesting the need  for a more intensive preventive strategy to optimize the management of NP lupus.";2010-2012
19;Novel association of acid phosphatase locus 1*C allele with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2012;Human immunology;Teruel M;The red cell acid phosphatase (ACP1) gene, which encodes a low-molecular-weight phosphotyrosine phosphatase, has been suggested as a common genetic factor of autoimmunity. In the present study, we aim to investigate the possible association of ACP1 with the susceptibility of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A total of 1,546 SLE patients and 1,947 healthy individuals from 4 Caucasians populations were included in the present study. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in this study: rs10167992, rs11553742, rs7576247, and rs3828329. ACP1*A, ACP1*B, and ACP1*C codominant ACP1 alleles were determined using 2 of the SNPs and analyzed. After the meta-analysis test was performed, a significant association of rs11553742*T was observed (p(pooled) = 0.005, odds ratios = 1.37 [1.10-1.70]), retaining significance after multiple testing was applied (p(FDR) = 0.019). Our data indicate for first time the association of rs11553742*T with increased susceptibility in SLE patients.;2010-2012
20;Use of atorvastatin in systemic lupus erythematosus in children and adolescents.;2012;Arthritis and rheumatism;Schanberg LE;"OBJECTIVE: Statins reduce atherosclerosis and cardiovascular morbidity in the general population, but their efficacy and safety in children and adolescents with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are unknown. This study was undertaken to determine the 3-year efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in preventing subclinical atherosclerosis progression in pediatric-onset SLE. METHODS: A total  of 221 participants with pediatric SLE (ages 10-21 years) from 21 North American  sites were enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Prevention in Pediatric Lupus Erythematosus study, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, between August 2003 and November 2006 with 36-month followup. Participants were randomized to receive atorvastatin (n=113) or placebo (n=108) at 10 or 20 mg/day depending on weight, in addition to usual care. The primary end point was  progression of mean-mean common carotid intima-media thickening (CIMT) measured by ultrasound. Secondary end points included other segment/wall-specific CIMT measures, lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, and SLE disease activity and damage outcomes. RESULTS: Progression of mean-mean common CIMT did not differ significantly between treatment groups (0.0010 mm/year for atorvastatin versus 0.0024 mm/year for placebo; P=0.24). The atorvastatin group achieved lower hsCRP (P=0.04), total cholesterol (P<0.001), and low-density lipoprotein (P<0.001) levels compared with placebo. In the placebo group, CIMT progressed significantly across all CIMT outcomes (0.0023-0.0144 mm/year; P<0.05). Serious adverse events and critical safety measures did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that routine statin use over 3 years has no significant effect on subclinical atherosclerosis progression in young SLE patients; however, further analyses may suggest subgroups that would benefit from targeted statin therapy. Atorvastatin was well tolerated without safety concerns.";2010-2012
21;Pioglitazone improves the cardiovascular profile in patients with uncomplicated systemic lupus erythematosus: a double-blind randomized clinical trial.;2012;Lupus;Juarez-Rojas JG;"OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect of pioglitazone on insulin levels, inflammation  markers, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) composition and subclasses distribution,  in young women with uncomplicated systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: This double-blind trial included 30 premenopausal women (30 +/-8 years old) with  SLE, who were randomized to pioglitazone (30 mg/day) or placebo treatment for 3 months. Plasma and HDL lipids were determined by colorimetric enzymatic assays, insulin by radioimmunometric assay, inflammation by immunonephelometry and HDL size and subclasses distribution by a native 4-30% polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, pioglitazone significantly increased HDL-cholesterol plasma levels (14.2%), reduced fasting insulin plasma levels (23.6%) and the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (31.7%). C-reactive protein (70.9%) and serum amyloid A (34.9%) were also significantly reduced with the pioglitazone use, whereas the HDL particle size was increased (8.80 nm vs. 8.95 nm; p = 0.044) by changes in the distribution of HDL(2b), HDL(3b), and HDL(3c) subclasses. The change in HDL size correlated with a rise in free and cholesterol-ester content in the HDL particles. CONCLUSION: Pioglitazone significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity, reduced inflammation, and modified HDL characteristics, suggesting a potential beneficial effect of this drug in patients with SLE with a risk to develop cardiovascular disease.

22;Genetic and physical interaction of the B-cell systemic lupus erythematosus-associated genes BANK1 and BLK.;2012;Annals of the rheumatic diseases; Castillejo-Lopez C;OBJECTIVES: Altered signalling in B cells is a predominant feature of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The genes BANK1 and BLK were recently described as associated with SLE. BANK1 codes for a B-cell-specific cytoplasmic protein involved in B-cell receptor signalling and BLK codes for an Src tyrosine kinase with important roles in B-cell development. To characterise the role of BANK1 and BLK in SLE, a genetic interaction analysis was performed hypothesising that genetic interactions could reveal functional pathways relevant to disease pathogenesis. METHODS: The GPAT16 method was used to analyse the gene-gene interactions of BANK1 and BLK. Confocal microscopy was used to investigate co-localisation, and immunoprecipitation was used to verify the physical interaction of BANK1 and BLK. RESULTS: Epistatic interactions between BANK1 and BLK polymorphisms associated with SLE were observed in a discovery set of 279 patients and 515 controls from northern Europe. A meta-analysis with 4399 European individuals confirmed the genetic interactions between BANK1 and BLK. As BANK1 was identified as a binding partner of the Src tyrosine kinase LYN, the possibility that BANK1 and BLK could also show a protein-protein interaction was  tested. The co-immunoprecipitation and co-localisation of BLK and BANK1 were demonstrated. In a Daudi cell line and primary naive B cells endogenous binding was enhanced upon B-cell receptor stimulation using anti-IgM antibodies. CONCLUSION: This study shows a genetic interaction between BANK1 and BLK, and demonstrates that these molecules interact physically. The results have important consequences for the understanding of SLE and other autoimmune diseases and identify a potential new signalling pathway. ;2010-2012

24;Effective plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid and its glucuronide in systemic lupus erythematosus patients in the remission-maintenance phase.;2012;Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics;Mino Y;WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been reported recently to be effective in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  The therapeutic range of mycophenolic acid (MPA) in SLE in the remission-maintenance phase remains to be clarified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of MMF and predose plasma concentrations of MPA and its phenolic glucuronide (MPAG) in patients with SLE in the remission-maintenance phase. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with SLE receiving a fixed dosage regimen of MMF (median and interquartile range, 1500 and 1000-2000mg/day) for at least 1month and who had not experienced any adverse drug reactions for more than 3months were enrolled. RESULTS: Significant improvement was observed after MMF administration in total haemolytic complement CH(50) and its fractions C3 and C4, immunoglobulins IgG, IgA and IgM, anti-dsDNA antibody, serum concentration of albumin and red blood cell count, even though the mean daily dose of prednisolone was significantly reduced (P=0.02). Median predose plasma concentrations of MPA and MPAG were 1.95 and 26.2mug/mL (interquartile ranges, 0.94-2.96 and 18.6-53.7 mug/mL). Predose plasma concentrations of MPA and MPAG correlated significantly with MMF dose (r=0.64, P<0.01 and r=0.39, P=0.03).  WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: MMF improved clinical laboratory markers and reduced prednisolone dosage in SLE patients with predose plasma concentration of MPA and  MPAG in the interquartile ranges of 0.94-2.96 and 18.6-53.7mug/mL, respectively.;2010-2012
25;Risk factors for avascular bone necrosis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2012;Rheumatology international;Sayarlioglu M;The objective was to investigate the predictive factors for avascular necrosis (AVN) of bone in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The records of 868 patients with SLE from four centers were reviewed retrospectively. Forty-nine patients with AVN were identified. A total of 154 patients with SLE who did not have clinically apparent AVN during the follow-up were evaluated as a control group. The demographic, clinical, laboratory and management characteristics of these two groups of patients were recorded according to predefined protocol and compared. The prevalence of AVN was detected 6% in our SLE population. The highest dose corticosteroid administered within 4 months and total cumulative prednisolone dose were significantly higher in the SLE patients with AVN. The use of cytotoxic agent significantly higher proportion of patients with AVN. AVN tends to develop more frequently in male gender and younger patients. Oral ulcer, pleuritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, cutaneous vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, autoimmune thyroiditis, peripheral neuropathy and Sjogren's syndrome were higher  incidence in SLE patients with AVN. The bilateral femoral heads were the commonest site of involvement of AVN in our patients with SLE.;2010-2012
26;Efficacy of estrogen plus progestin on menopausal symptoms in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.;2011;Arthritis care & research;Cravioto MD;"OBJECTIVE: To define the effects of continuous sequential estrogen plus progestin therapy on menopausal symptoms in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, 24-month clinical trial involving 106 women with SLE who were in the menopausal transition or early or late postmenopause. Patients received continuous sequential estrogen plus progestin (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54). Menopausal symptoms were assessed using the Greene Climacteric Scale at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months.  A new factor analysis of the scale reduced 21 items to 5 factors. The primary outcome was improvement of menopausal symptoms throughout the followup period. Results were analyzed by the intent-to-treat principle. RESULTS: At baseline, demographic and disease characteristics were similar in both groups. Fifteen of 21 menopausal symptoms had a prevalence of >/=50%, with a similar distribution between groups. Vasomotor factor scores decreased over time in both groups (P = 0.002), but in the estrogen plus progestin group the reduction was more pronounced than in the placebo group (1.5-2.0 versus 0.35-0.8 points on a scale of 0-6; P = 0.03). Maximum effects were observed among the most symptomatic women. Psychological, subjective-somatic, and organic-somatic factors scores also improved along time (P < 0.001), but the treatment and placebo arms improved to a similar degree. Thromboses occurred in 3 patients receiving estrogen plus progestin and in 1 patient receiving placebo. CONCLUSION: Menopausal symptoms are highly prevalent in peri- and postmenopausal lupus patients. Estrogen plus progestin improved vasomotor symptoms at a clinically significant level, but not  other menopausal symptoms. Given the thrombotic risks of menopausal hormone therapy, this should be used only in women with significant vasomotor symptoms.";2010-2012
27;Dual effect of the macrophage migration inhibitory factor gene on the development and severity of human systemic lupus erythematosus.;2011;Arthritis and rheumatism;Sreih A;"OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of the innate cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) on the susceptibility and severity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a multinational population of 1,369 Caucasian and African  American patients. METHODS: Two functional polymorphisms in the MIF gene, a -794  CATT(5-8) microsatellite repeat (rs5844572) and a -173 G/C single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs755622), were assessed for association with SLE in 3,195 patients and healthy controls. We also measured MIF plasma levels in relation to genotypes and clinical phenotypes, and assessed Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7)-stimulated MIF production in vitro. RESULTS: Both Caucasians and African Americans with the high-expression MIF haplotype -794 CATT(7)/-173*C had a lower incidence of SLE (in Caucasians, odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.53-0.89, P = 0.001; in African Americans, OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23-0.95, P = 0.012). In contrast, among patients with established SLE, reduced frequencies of low-expression MIF genotypes (-794 CATT(5)) were observed in those with nephritis, those with serositis, and those with central nervous system (CNS) involvement when compared to patients without end-organ involvement (P = 0.023, P = 0.005, and P = 0.04, respectively). Plasma MIF levels and TLR-7-stimulated MIF  production in vitro reflected the underlying MIF genotype of the studied groups.  CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that MIF, which has both proinflammatory properties and macrophage and B cell survival functions, exerts a dual influence  on the immunopathogenesis of SLE. High-expression MIF genotypes are associated with a reduced susceptibility to SLE and may contribute to an enhanced clearance  of infectious pathogens. Once SLE develops, however, low-expression MIF genotypes may protect from ensuing inflammatory end-organ damage.";2010-2012
28;A phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled study of belimumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits B lymphocyte stimulator, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2011;Arthritis and rheumatism;Furie R;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy/safety of the B lymphocyte stimulator inhibitor belimumab plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy in active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: In a phase III, multicenter,  randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 819 antinuclear antibody-positive or anti-double-stranded DNA-positive SLE patients with scores >/=6 on the Safety of  Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA) version of the SLE  Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 mg/kg belimumab, 10 mg/kg belimumab, or placebo intravenously on days 0, 14, and  28 and then every 28 days for 72 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the SLE Responder Index (SRI) response rate at week 52 (an SRI response was defined as a >/=4-point reduction in SELENA-SLEDAI score, no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group [BILAG] A organ domain score and no more than 1 new BILAG B score, and no worsening in physician's global assessment score versus baseline).  RESULTS: Belimumab at 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy met the primary efficacy end point, generating a significantly greater SRI response at week 52 compared with placebo (43.2% versus 33.5%; P = 0.017). The rate with 1 mg/kg belimumab was 40.6% (P = 0.089). Response rates at week 76 were 32.4%, 39.1%, and 38.5% with placebo, 1 mg/kg belimumab, and 10 mg/kg belimumab, respectively. In post hoc sensitivity analyses evaluating higher SELENA-SLEDAI score thresholds, 10 mg/kg belimumab achieved better discrimination at weeks 52 and 76. Risk of severe flares over 76 weeks (based on the modified SLE Flare Index) was reduced with 1 mg/kg belimumab (34%) (P = 0.023) and 10 mg/kg belimumab (23%) (P = 0.13). Serious and severe adverse events, including infections, laboratory abnormalities, malignancies, and deaths, were comparable across groups. CONCLUSION: Belimumab plus standard therapy significantly improved SRI response rate, reduced SLE disease activity and severe flares, and was generally well tolerated in SLE.";2010-2012
29;Association of tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene polymorphisms with juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus nephritis in a cohort of egyptian patients.;2011;Iranian journal of kidney diseases;Farid TM;"INTRODUCTION: The production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha has been deeply deregulated in systemic lupus erythematosus. We evaluated the association of -863C>A and -1031T>C polymorphisms of the TNF gene with susceptibility to and clinical manifestations of juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was performed on 70 juvenile patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (mean age, 13.0 +/- 4.2 years). Ninety age- and sex-matched children served as a controls. All participants were genotyped for the TNF -863C>A and -1031T>C polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Analysis of serum TNF-alpha was done by solid-phase sandwich enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: The mean serum TNF-alpha was significantly higher in the SLE patients compared to controls (P < .001). Regarding all participants, the mean serum TNF-alpha was significantly higher in  children with -863AA genotype compared to carriers of -863C allele (P < .001). The TNF -863AA genotype frequencies were significantly higher in the patients group compared with the controls (P = .005) and were associated with increased risk for SLE development (odds ratio, 4.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.38 to 13.13; P = .005). The -863AA variant was associated with nephritis (P < .001) and Raynaud phenomenon (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The -863A allele of the TNF gene can  be used as a genetic marker for SLE susceptibility and was associated with high TNF-alpha production, Raynaud phenomenon, and nephritis in juvenile SLE Egyptian  patients.";2010-2012
30;Hepatitis B vaccination in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus.;2011;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Aytac MB;OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examined the antibody responses after recombinant hepatitis B vaccine in juvenile SLE patients and whether antibody levels were affected by immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: This study consisted of 64 juvenile SLE patients and 24 healthy controls. We evaluated HBsAg, Anti-HBs and Anti-HbcIgG titers in SLE patients. 24 patients (37%) were non-immunised, 39 patients were immunised (61%) and 1 patient (1.5%) was chronic hepatitis B carrier. Of the 24 non-immunised patients, 3 had active disease (SLEDAI>10) and 1 was being treated for tuberculosis infection so they were not included in the vaccination program. Twenty non-immunised SLE patients were given 3 dose recombinant hepatitis B vaccine doses at 0,1,6 months. AntiHBs antibody titer >10 IU/ml one month after the last dose of vaccine was accepted as seroconversion. RESULTS: After 3 doses of vaccination, 16 (80%) of SLE patients and all of the healthy controls had seroconversion. Since two patients had SLEDAI score >10 after the first 2 doses of vaccine and one patient had SLEDAI score >10 after the first dose, these patients were given only two doses of hepatitis B vaccine. These patients had already seroconverted. One patient had exacerbation of the disease one month after the third dose of the vaccine. Protective antibody responses were statistically insignificant between the two groups (p=0.49). Geometric mean antibody titers of SLE patients were lower than those of the healthy controls. Adequate antibody response was not affected by immunosuppressive treatment as prednisone, azathioprine, and hydroxychloroquine.  CONCLUSIONS: Juvenile SLE patients could reach an adequate antibody response after recombinant hepatitis B vaccination and this response is not affected by immunosuppressive treatment.;2010-2012
31;Pharmacokinetics of prednisolone at steady state in young patients with systemic  lupus erythematosus on prednisone therapy: an open-label, single-dose study.;2011;Clinical therapeutics;Sagcal-Gironella AC;BACKGROUND: Current prednisone dosing in the treatment of young patients with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) is largely based on achieving balance between therapeutic efficacy and toxicity, with weight-based dosing a common clinical practice. Despite the widespread use of prednisone, few attempts  have been made to improve its clinical dosing regimen, and response to prednisone therapy remains variable. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of prednisolone, the metabolite  of the prodrug prednisone, in cSLE patients and explore the relationship between  PK properties and cSLE disease activity. METHODS: Blood samples were taken 1 hour before the morning prednisone dose and at 20, 40, 60, and 90 minutes, and 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 hours from 8 patients (ages 12-28 years) after an 8-hour fast. The mean weight-adjusted daily prednisone dose, stable for at least 30 days pre-study, was 0.29 mg/kg/d. PK analysis of prednisolone was performed using noncompartmental analysis with WinNonlin. cSLE disease activity was measured using the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group index and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index. RESULTS: Mean total prednisolone AUC(0-9),  prednisone CL/F at steady state, and half-life were 1094 (range, 467-2404) ng/h/mL, 11 (range, 6.7-13.7) L/hr, and 2.6 (range, 1.3-3.9) hours. Mean total prednisolone AUC(0-9) normalized to prednisone dose by weight was 4361 (range, 1136-9580) ng/h/mL/mg/kg. Mean total prednisolone C(max) normalized to prednisone dose by weight was 1097 (range, 301-2211) ng/mL/mg/kg at 1.84 (range, 0.48-4) hours (T(max)). Patients on prednisone had interindividual variability in prednisolone AUC(0-9) (61% CV) and dose-adjusted AUC(0-9) (58% CV). CONCLUSIONS:  Interindividual variability in systemic exposure to prednisolone in cSLE patients was observed.;2010-2012
32;Octreotide for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus: clinical effects and an in vitro study on its therapeutic mechanism.;2011;Lupus;Zhang Y;Increased serum growth hormone (GH), together with high expression of growth hormone receptor on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), correlates with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) activity, suggesting that modulation of GH signaling may affect SLE activity. We explored the effects of octreotide (OCT), an analog of somatostatin that suppresses the release of GH, in SLE. The objectives of the study were to investigate effects of OCT on the proliferative capacity and cytokine expression of PBMCs from patients with SLE and to investigate therapeutic effects of OCT in patients with SLE. PBMCs from 13 active/inactive SLE patients and 11 controls were pretreated with or without GH and cultured with OCT. The proliferation of PBMCs was assessed by MTT assay and cytokines were quantified by ELISA. We compared the clinical response of 12 patients with SLE treated with OCT (100 microg twice daily) with 12 patients treated with prednisone over three months. OCT inhibited PBMC proliferation in a  dose-dependent manner and decreased the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Patients treated with OCT demonstrated improvements in SLEDAI, dsDNA titer, complement levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). OCT inhibited PBMC proliferation and PBMC secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-gamma stimulated by GH. Treatment of patients with OCT resulted in clinical improvement in SLE.;2010-2012
33;Autoantibodies as biomarkers for the prediction of neuropsychiatric events in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2011;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Hanly JG;OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychiatric events occur unpredictably in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and most biomarker associations remain to be prospectively validated. This study examined a disease inception cohort of 1047 SLE patients to determine which autoantibodies at enrolment predicted subsequent neuropsychiatric events. METHODS: Patients with a recent SLE diagnosis were assessed prospectively for up to 10 years for neuropsychiatric events using the American College of Rheumatology case definitions. Decision rules of graded stringency determined whether neuropsychiatric events were attributable to SLE. Associations between the first neuropsychiatric event and baseline autoantibodies (lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin, anti-beta(2) glycoprotein-I, anti-ribosomal P and anti-NR2 glutamate receptor) were tested by Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS:  Disease duration at enrolment was 5.4 +/- 4.2 months, follow-up was 3.6 +/- 2.6 years. Patients were 89.1% female with mean (+/-SD) age 35.2 +/- 13.7 years. 495/1047 (47.3%) developed one or more neuropsychiatric event (total 917 events). Neuropsychiatric events attributed to SLE were 15.4% (model A) and 28.2% (model B). At enrolment 21.9% of patients had LA, 13.4% anticardiolipin, 15.1% anti-beta(2) glycoprotein-I, 9.2% anti-ribosomal P and 13.7% anti-NR2 antibodies. LA at baseline was associated with subsequent intracranial thrombosis (total n=22) attributed to SLE (model B) (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.94). Anti-ribosomal  P antibody was associated with subsequent psychosis (total n=14) attributed to SLE (model B) (HR 3.92, 95% CI 1.23 to 12.5, p=0.02). Other autoantibodies did not predict neuropsychiatric events. CONCLUSION: In a prospective study of 1047 recently diagnosed SLE patients, LA and anti-ribosomal P antibodies are associated with an increased future risk of intracranial thrombosis and lupus psychosis, respectively.;2010-2012
34;Predictors of progression in atherosclerosis over 2 years in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2011;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Kiani AN;OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease remains the major cause of death in SLE. We assessed the degree to which cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) and disease activity were associated with 2-year changes in measures of subclinical atherosclerosis. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-seven SLE patients participating in a placebo-controlled trial of atorvastatin underwent multi-detector CT [for coronary artery calcium (CAC)] and carotid duplex [for carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid plaque] twice, 2 years apart. During the 2 years, patients were assessed every 3 months for CVRF. Both groups were combined for analysis, as atorvastatin did not differ from placebo in preventing progression of coronary calcium. We examined the correlation between these clinical measures  and progression of CAC, IMT and plaque during the follow-up period. RESULTS: In an analysis adjusting for age, gender and ethnicity, CAC progression was positively associated with total serum cholesterol measured over the 2-year period (P = 0.04) and smoking (P = 0.003). Carotid IMT progression was associated with systolic BP (P = 0.003), high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) (P = 0.013) and white  blood cell (WBC) count (P = 0.029). Carotid plaque progression, defined as patients without carotid plaque at baseline with subsequent development of plaque at follow-up, was associated with systolic BP (P = 0.003), WBC count (P = 0.02),  physician's global assessment (P = 0.05), blood lymphocyte count (P = 0.048), urine protein (P = 0.017) and duration of SLE (P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Our data did not provide evidence of an association between measures of SLE disease activity (SLEDAI, anti-dsDNA, anti-phospholipid and treatment) and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis. Age and hypertension were associated with the progression of carotid IMT and plaque. Age, smoking and cholesterol were associated with progression of CAC.;2010-2012
35;Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, myositis, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma share activation of a common type I interferon pathway.;2011;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Higgs BW;OBJECTIVE: To characterise activation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic scleroderma (SSc) and to evaluate the potential to develop a molecular diagnostic tool from the peripheral blood that reflects this activation in disease-affected tissues. METHODS: Overexpressed transcripts were identified in the whole blood (WB) of 262 patients with SLE, 44 with DM, 33 with PM, 28 with SSc and 89 with RA and compared with 24 healthy subjects using Affymetrix microarrays. A five gene type  I IFN signature was assessed in these subjects to identify subpopulations showing both activation and concordance of the type I IFN pathway in the peripheral blood and disease-affected tissues of each disease and to correlate activation of this  pathway in the WB with clinical measurements. RESULTS: A common set of 36 type I  IFN inducible transcripts were identified among the most overexpressed in the WB  of all subjects. Significant activation of the type I IFN pathway in subgroups of each of the five diseases studied was observed. Baseline disease activity measurements correlated with a type I IFN gene signature in the WB of subjects with SLE, PM and SSc, as did various serum autoantibody levels in subjects with SLE and DM. This signature was also well correlated between disease-affected tissue and WB in subjects with SLE, DM, PM and SSc. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the type I IFN pathway is activated in patient subsets of five rheumatic diseases and suggest that these subsets may benefit from anti-IFN therapy.;2010-2012

METHODS: Safety profile, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of sifalimumab, an anti-IFNalpha monoclonal antibody, were assessed in a phase I, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, dose-escalation study with an open-label extension in adults with moderately active SLE. SUBJECTS: received one intravenous dose of sifalimumab (n=33 blinded phase, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg; n=17 open-label, 1, 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg) or placebo (n=17). Each phase lasted 84 days. RESULTS: Adverse events (AEs) were similar between groups; about 97% of AEs were grade 1 or 2. All grade  3 and 4 AEs and all serious AEs (2 placebo, 1 sifalimumab) were deemed unrelated  to the study drug. No increase in viral infections or reactivation was observed.  Sifalimumab caused dose-dependent inhibition of type I IFN-induced mRNAs (type I  IFN signature) in whole blood and corresponding changes in related proteins in affected skin. Exploratory analyses showed consistent trends toward improvement in disease activity in sifalimumab-treated versus placebo-treated subjects. A lower proportion of sifalimumab-treated subjects required new or increased immunosuppressive treatments (12% vs 41%; p=0.03) and had fewer Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index flares (3% vs 29%; p=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Sifalimumab had a safety profile that supports further clinical development. This trial demonstrated that overexpression of type I IFN signature in SLE is at least partly driven by IFNalpha, and exploratory analyses suggest that IFNalpha inhibition may be associated with clinical benefit in SLE.

38;Preliminary study of a traditional Chinese medicine formula in systemic lupus erythematosus patients to taper steroid dose and prevent disease flare-up.;2011;The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences;Liao YN;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease. Prolonged complete remission is rare. Most patients with SLE need long-term treatment with glucocorticoid and immunomodulators. However, side effects because of the above medications are common. We evaluated the effect of adding-on Dan-Chi-Liu-Wei combination (DCLWC) on SLE patients with conventional therapy in  tapering steroid and preventing disease flare-up. This was a double-blind and randomized controlled trial. Sixty-six SLE patients were recruited into this study and 53 patients who fulfilled the 1997 revised criteria for the classification of SLE with an SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score of 2-12 and a steroid (measured with prednisolone) daily dose of less than 20mg/d were enrolled. The patients were randomized into either an experimental or control group. We checked the urine analysis, hemogram, liver function, renal function, C3, C4, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and anti-dsDNA, evaluated the SLEDAI score, and recorded the steroid dose at 0 months, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. After 6 months of study, the C4 and blood urea nitrogen level revealed a statistically significant difference in either group. There was a tendency toward a decreased SLEDAI score in the experimental group (p=0.083) but  not in the control group (p=0.867). The steroid dose was not statistically significant in either group. Renal function and liver function revealed no statistically significant statistics changes in either group. Adding-on DCLWC to  conventional therapy for the treatment of SLE was safe and might have a borderline effect in decreasing disease activity, but it was not possible to taper the dosage of steroid after 6 months of clinical trial. Therefore, a long-term follow-up and a large-scale study are necessary to confirm the effect of DCLWC.;2010-2012
39;Clinical expression and morbidity of systemic lupus erythematosus during a post-diagnostic 5-year follow-up: a male:female comparison.;2011;Lupus;Stefanidou S;The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of the most relevant clinical features of the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a sample of male patients with lupus as well as the incidence of the main causes of morbidity in a 5-year period after the diagnosis. A further aim of this study was to investigate the impact of gender on expression and morbidity of SLE. Data were collected from the medical records of 59 male and 535 female patients with SLE who were diagnosed at the hospitals in the region of Thessaloniki. Several differences in the expression and morbidity of the disease were found in relation to the gender of the patient. Male patients had a higher prevalence of thromboses, nephropathy, strokes, gastrointestinal tract symptoms and antiphospholipid syndrome when compared with female patients, but tended to present less often with arthralgia, hair loss, Raynaud's phenomenon and photosensitivity as the initial clinical manifestations. During the 5-year follow-up, positive associations have been found between male gender and the incidence of tendonitis, myositis, nephropathy and infections, particularly of the respiratory tract. In conclusion, this study has provided information regarding the features of clinical expression and morbidity in male patients, and has shown that gender is a possible factor that can influence the clinical expression of SLE.;2010-2012
40;Deletion of LCE3C_LCE3B is associated with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus in the Chinese Han population.;2011;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Lu X;"OBJECTIVES: The deletion of LCE3C_LCE3B confers susceptibility to psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Caucasians. The aim of this study was to investigate the variant involvement in RA in the Chinese Han population and to further explore its potential role in the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE). METHODS: LCE3C_LCE3B-del was genotyped in 898 patients with RA and 681 healthy controls. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs4112788 and rs4085613) in strong linkage disequilibrium with LCE3C_LCE3B-del were then genotyped in patients with RA (n=1222), SLE (n=870) and healthy controls (n=1031). RESULTS: The deletion of LCE3C_LCE3B and SNPs rs4112788 and rs4085613 showed an association with RA (allele analysis: p=7.72x10(-4), OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.47; p=6.39x10(-4), OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.38; and p=5.38x10(-4), OR  1.23, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.39, respectively). The two SNPs were also signi fi cantly  associated with SLE (allele analysis: p=7.68x10(-3), OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36 and p=5.30x10(-3), OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.37). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for an association between LCE3C_LCE3B-del and RA in non-Caucasian populations, and SNPs rs4112788 and rs4085613 tagging LCE3C_LCE3B-del were novel susceptibility factors for SLE.";2010-2012
41;Preliminary criteria for global flares in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus.;2011;Arthritis care & research;Brunner HI;"OBJECTIVE: To develop widely acceptable preliminary criteria of global flare for  childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE). METHODS: Pediatric rheumatologists (n = 138) rated a total of 358 unique patient profiles with information about the cSLE flare descriptors from 2 consecutive visits: patient global assessment of well-being, physician global assessment of disease activity  (MD-global), health-related quality of life, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, disease activity index scores, protein:creatinine (P:C) ratio, complement levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Based on 2,996 rater responses about the course of cSLE (baseline versus followup), the accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of candidate flare criteria was assessed. An international consensus conference was  held to rank these candidate flare criteria as per the American College of Rheumatology recommendations for the development and validation of criteria sets. RESULTS: The highest-ranked candidate criteria considered absolute changes (Delta) of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) or British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG), MD-global, P:C ratio, and ESR; flare scores can be calculated (0.5 x DeltaSLEDAI + 0.45 x DeltaP:C ratio + 0.5 x DeltaMD-global + 0.02 x DeltaESR), where values of >/=1.04 are reflective of a flare. Similarly, BILAG-based flare scores (0.4 x DeltaBILAG + 0.65 x DeltaP:C ratio + 0.5 x DeltaMD-global + 0.02 x DeltaESR) of >/=1.15 were diagnostic of a flare. Flare scores increased with flare severity. CONCLUSION: Consensus has been reached on preliminary criteria for global flares in cSLE. Further validation studies are needed to confirm the usefulness of the cSLE flare criteria in research and for clinical care.";2010-2012
42;Association of the Charlson comorbidity index with mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2011;Arthritis care & research;Jonsen A;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether comorbidity as assessed by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is associated with mortality in a long-term followup of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. METHODS: Data were collected from 499 SLE patients attending the Lupus Clinic at the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and 170 SLE patients from the Department of Rheumatology at Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. This included data on comorbidity, demographics, disease activity, the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI), and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Variables were entered into a Cox proportional hazards survival model. RESULTS: Mortality risk in the Montreal cohort was associated with the CCI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.57 per unit increase in the CCI, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.18-2.09) and age (HR 1.04 per year increase in age, 95% CI 1.00-1.09). The CCI and age at diagnosis were also associated with mortality in the Lund cohort (CCI: HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13-1.60; age: HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.12). Furthermore, the SDI was associated with mortality in the Lund cohort (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.19-1.64), while a wide CI for the estimate in the Montreal cohort prevented a definitive conclusion (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.97-1.48). We did not find a strong association between mortality and sex, race/ethnicity, disease activity, or APS in either cohort. CONCLUSION: In this study, comorbidity as measured by the CCI was associated with decreased survival  independent of age, lupus disease activity, and damage. This suggests that the CCI may be useful in capturing comorbidity for clinical research in SLE.";2010-2012
43;B cell biomarkers of rituximab responses in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2011;Arthritis and rheumatism;Vital EM;OBJECTIVE: Rituximab appears to be effective in many studies of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with variable initial clinical response and time to relapse.;2010-2012
44;Lack of cardiovascular risk assessment in inflammatory arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus patients at a tertiary care center.;2011;Clinical rheumatology;Keeling SO;The purpose of this study is to evaluate cardiovascular risk assessment at a Canadian rheumatology center and describe the cardiovascular risk of inflammatory arthritis (IA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients using the Framingham risk score. A retrospective chart review of 504 patients attending nine rheumatology practices at the University of Alberta Hospital was performed.  A pre-specified case report form detailed patient demographics, cardiac risk factors, variables for the Framingham 2008 score, disease activity, and medication use. In this group of 504 patients, 64 (12.7%) had SLE (male (M) to female (F) ratio = 60:4) and 440 (87.3%) had an IA (M to F ratio = 117:323). Of the SLE patients, 31 (48.4%) met four or more American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, 33 (51.6%) had less than four ACR criteria. Of the IA patients, 156 (35.5%) were CCP positive and 257 (58.4%) were RF positive. Utilizing the chart data, retrospective Framingham risk scores were calculable for one (1.6%) SLE patient and three (0.68%) IA patients. The most common cardiac risk factors not documented in the medical records of both the SLE and IA patients included: (1) positive family history of MI, (2) diabetes, and (3) lipid status. The blood  pressure was more frequently documented in the SLE patients (93.8%) compared to the IA patients (56.1%). While traditional cardiac risk factors only partially contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in these patients, cardiovascular risk assessment was suboptimally performed amongst a large group of rheumatologists. A dedicated cardiovascular risk reduction clinic for inflammatory rheumatic diseases has been established at this site to fulfill this need and evaluate treatment strategies.;2010-2012
45;Prognostic indicators of hospitalized patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a large retrospective multicenter study in China.;2011;The Journal of rheumatology;Feng X;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mortality of hospitalized patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and determine the influential factors associated with poor prognosis. METHODS: Medical records of 1956 SLE inpatients from 15 hospitals during the period January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2009, were reviewed. All patients were followed up in January 2010. Potential factors associated with mortality were analyzed, comparing patients who were living with those who were deceased. The independency of those factors significantly related to death was determined by Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Male to female ratio was 1:15 in  this cohort; median age at disease onset was 30 years. Hematologic (70.0%), mucocutaneous (68.2%), musculoskeletal (57.9%), and renal (48.7%) involvements were most often seen in these patients at time of admission. The overall mortality was 8.5% (n = 166), with infection (25.9%), renal failure (19.3%), and  neuropsychiatric lupus (18.7%) the leading 3 causes of death. Independent predictors for mortality in this cohort of SLE patients were neuropsychiatric involvement [hazard ratio (HR) 2.19], anemia (HR 1.69), SLEDAI score > 8 at discharge (HR 1.64), increased serum creatinine (HR 1.57), low serum albumin (HR  1.56), cardiopulmonary involvement (HR 1.55), and patient untreated before admission (HR 1.48), whereas the use of antimalarial drugs (HR 0.62) and positive anti-Sm antibody (HR 0.60) were shown to be protective factors. CONCLUSION: SLE patients with delayed treatment and refractory disease have poorer prognosis. A high incidence of death would be expected if they have neuropsychiatric involvement, anemia, azotemia, or cardiopulmonary involvement. Combination therapy with antimalarial drugs may provide some benefit to patients with SLE.";2010-2012
46;Memantine in systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial.;2011;Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism;Petri M;OBJECTIVES: Cognitive impairment affects up to 80% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients within 10 years of diagnosis. Memantine, a seronergic receptor and nicotine acetylcholine receptor antagonist, acts on the glutamatergic system through the NMDA receptor and is used to treat dementia. We  investigated whether it had benefit for SLE cognitive impairment. METHODS: A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled single-center 12-week trial of memantine titrated to 20 mg/d was performed, using a 2:1 randomization ratio, in  51 SLE patients. The primary outcome measures were change in the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics throughput scores at 12 weeks. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups or change from baseline in any of the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics throughput scores at 6 or 12 weeks. For the American College of Rheumatology cognitive battery, the only statistically significant findings were  for the Controlled Oral Word Association Test-S words at 6 and 12 weeks. At 12 weeks, the memantine group exhibited greater improvement compared with the placebo group (3.6 +/- 1.8 vs 0.5 +/- 3.8 words, P = 0.03). In a subset analysis  limited to patients that scored >/=1 standard deviation below normal controls at  baseline, no significant differences between treatment groups were found. CONCLUSIONS: In this first clinical trial of memantine in SLE, patients treated with memantine did not exhibit significant improvement in cognitive performance compared with the placebo group, regardless of the degree of impairment at baseline, with the exception of controlled oral word association.;2010-2012
47;Neuropsychological assessment in systemic lupus erythematosus patients: clinical  usefulness of first-choice diagnostic tests in detecting cognitive impairment and preliminary diagnosis of neuropsychiatric lupus.;2011;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Nowicka-Sauer K;OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the usefulness of neuropsychological tests in order to distinguish the first-choice methods useful in quick detection of cognitive impairment in SLE and preliminary diagnosis of neuropsychiatric manifestation. Study aimed at assessment of the prevalence and severity of cognitive deficits in SLE patients and comparison between SLE patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations (NP-SLE) and without ones (non-NP-SLE). METHODS: 93 out of 104 SLE patients, 57 with NP-SLE and 36 with non-NP-SLE underwent comprehensive neuropsychological examination. Tailor-made structured interview for neuropsychological assessment in SLE (SISLE) was used. Patients' emotional state  was assessed by clinical interview and HADS. RESULTS: Cognitive dysfunction was identified in 57% of SLE patients, 48.4% in 1-3 tests, 8.6% (8 patients) in 4 or  more tests (severe decline). Among impaired patients 15% had severe decline. In NP-SLE group 63.2% were impaired vs. 47.2% in non-NP-SLE group. All 8 patients with severe decline were NP-SLE. The dysfunction was irrespective of premorbid intellectual level, age, education, disease duration and steroid treatment. In NP-SLE significantly lower scores were observed in 8 tests (10 parameters). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive dysfunction is frequent in SLE patients. The majority of patients has mild deficits, but severe decline is also observed. The dysfunction  is more frequent and more pronounced in NP-SLE. The study distinguished 8-test-first-choicebattery useful in detecting cognitive impairment in SLE and in case of severe decline - in preliminary differentiating NP-SLE and non-NP-SLE. Structured interview for psychological/neuropsychological examination of SLE patients is a useful and required tool for a standard patients' assessment.;2010-2012
48;Systemic lupus erythematosus complicated with femoral head ischemic necrosis treated by Chinese medicine therapy for activating blood and dredging collaterals method.;2011;Chinese journal of integrative medicine;Wang W;OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect and mechanism of Chinese medicine therapy for activating blood and dredging collaterals (ABDC) on treating systemic lupus erythematosus complicated with avascular necrosis of the femoral head (SLE-ANFH). METHODS: Thirty-four patients (51 joints) with SLE-ANFH were assigned by a random number table to two groups: 22 patients (32 joints) in the treatment group and 12 patients (19 joints) in the control group. All received Western medical conventional treatment for anti-inflammation and immunosuppression, but an additional Chinese medicine decoction prescribed based on ABDC principle was administered to patients in the treatment group. The observation on the patients' condition and therapeutic effect lasted for 3 years. RESULTS: The patients' conditions in the two groups, as assessed by Association for Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) staging, were similar before treatment. After treatment, comparison between groups showed significant difference (P<0.05), and the raised  Harris functional scores in the treatment group were higher than that in the control group (P<0.01). The post-treatment symptom improving rate in the treated  group was 72.73%, which was higher than that in the control group (50.00%, P<0.05). Moreover, the former was superior in improving hematologic and hemorrheologic parameters in terms of prolonging activated partial thromboplastin time, lowering whole blood middle/low shear viscosity, and plasma viscosity (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Two patients in the control group but none in the treatment group received hip joint replacement operation during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese medicine ABDC therapy could effectively alleviate clinical symptoms and improve joint function of patients with SLE-ANFH. The mechanism may  be related to its effects on improving high coagulation manner and trend for getting embolism.;2010-2012
49;SF-36 summary and subscale scores are reliable outcomes of neuropsychiatric events in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2011;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Hanly JG;"OBJECTIVE: To examine change in health-related quality of life in association with clinical outcomes of neuropsychiatric events in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: An international study evaluated newly diagnosed SLE patients for neuropsychiatric events attributed to SLE and non-SLE causes. The outcome of events was determined by a physician-completed seven-point scale and compared with patient-completed Short Form 36 (SF-36) health survey questionnaires. Statistical analysis used linear mixed-effects regression models with patient-specific random effects. RESULTS: 274 patients (92% female; 68% Caucasian), from a cohort of 1400, had one or more neuropsychiatric event in which the interval between assessments was 12.3 +/- 2 months. The overall difference in change between visits in mental component summary (MCS) scores of the SF-36 was significant (p<0.0001) following adjustments for gender, ethnicity, centre and previous score. A consistent improvement in neuropsychiatric status (N=295) was associated with an increase in the mean (SD) adjusted MCS score of 3.66 (0.89) in SF-36 scores. Between paired visits when the neuropsychiatric status consistently deteriorated (N=30), the adjusted MCS score decreased by 4.00 (1.96). For the physical component summary scores the corresponding changes were  +1.73 (0.71) and -0.62 (1.58) (p<0.05), respectively. Changes in SF-36 subscales  were in the same direction (p<0.05; with the exception of role physical). Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings. Adjustment for age, education, medications, SLE disease activity, organ damage, disease duration, attribution and characteristics of neuropsychiatric events did not substantially alter the results. CONCLUSION: Changes in SF-36 summary and subscale scores, in particular  those related to mental health, are strongly associated with the clinical outcome of neuropsychiatric events in SLE patients.";2010-2012
50;Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 responder index-50: a reliable index for measuring improvement in disease activity.;2011;The Journal of rheumatology;Touma Z;OBJECTIVE: To test the interrater and intrarater reliability of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) Responder Index (SRI-50), an index designed to measure >/= 50% improvement in disease activity between visits in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study with raters from Canada, the United Kingdom, and Argentina. Patient profile scenarios were derived from real adult patients. Ten rheumatologists from university and community hospitals and postdoctoral rheumatology fellows participated. An SRI-50 data retrieval form was used. Each rheumatologist scored SLEDAI-2K at the baseline visit and SRI-50 on followup visit, for the same patients, on 2 occasions 2 weeks apart. Physician global assessment (PGA) was determined on a numerical scale at baseline visit and a Likert scale on followup visit. Interrater and intrarater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and kappa statistics whenever applicable. RESULTS: Forty patient profiles were created. The ICC performed on 80 patient profiles for interrater ranged from 1.00 for SLEDAI-2K and SRI-50 to 0.96 for PGA. The intrarater ICC for SLEDAI-2K, SRI-50, and PGA scores ranged from 1.00 to 0.86. Substantial agreement was determined for the interrater Likert scale, with a kappa statistic of 0.57. CONCLUSION: The SRI-50 is reliable to assess >/= 50% improvement in lupus disease activity. Use of the SRI-50 data retrieval form is essential to ensure optimal performance of the SRI-50. SRI-50 can be used by both rheumatologists and trainees and performs equally well in trained as well as untrained rheumatologists.;2010-2012
51;Using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale to screen for depression in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2011;Arthritis care & research;Julian LJ;"OBJECTIVE: Identifying persons with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) at risk for depression would facilitate the identification and treatment of an important  comorbidity conferring additional risk for poor outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of a brief screening measure, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), in detecting mood disorders in persons with SLE. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined 150 persons with SLE. Screening cut points were empirically derived using threshold selection methods, and receiver operating characteristic curves were estimated. The empirically derived cut points of the CES-D were used as the screening measures and were compared to other commonly used CES-D cut points in addition to other commonly used methods to screen for depression. Diagnoses of major depressive disorder or other mood disorders were determined using a ""gold standard"" structured clinical interview. RESULTS: Of the 150 persons with SLE, 26% of subjects met criteria for any mood disorder and 17% met criteria for major depressive disorder. Optimal threshold estimations suggested a CES-D cut score of 24 and above, which yielded adequate sensitivity and specificity in detecting major depressive disorder (88% and 93%, respectively) and correctly classified 92% of participants. To detect the presence of any mood disorder, a cut score of  20 and above was suggested, yielding sensitivity and specificity of 87% and correctly classifying 87%. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the CES-D may be a useful screening measure to identify patients at risk for depression.";2010-2012
52;Serum free light chains as biomarkers for systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity.;2011;Arthritis care & research;Aggarwal R;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate serum free light chains (FLC) as a putative biomarker of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) activity. METHODS: Seventy-five SLE patients and 41 age- and sex-matched rheumatoid arthritis (RA) controls were enrolled. Disease activity was assessed using the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus: National Assessment version of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) definition and physician global assessments for SLE and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints for RA. Serum FLC levels were compared against other biomarkers (IgG, C3, C4, double-stranded DNA [dsDNA] antibody). Nonparametric tests were used to compare 1) FLC and IgG in SLE versus  RA and healthy controls, 2) FLC and IgG among different levels of activity in SLE, and 3) FLC in active versus nonactive RA. Correlation of FLC, C3, C4, dsDNA  antibody, and IgG with the SLEDAI and modified SLEDAI (M-SLEDAI) were obtained. RESULTS: FLC was higher in SLE than in RA; both were higher than referent healthy controls. Total FLC was significantly higher in subjects with greater SLE disease activity than lower/no activity. There were no significant differences in IgG, C4, or dsDNA antibody stratified by disease activity. Total FLC and C3 showed moderate to strong correlation with the SLEDAI and M-SLEDAI. In RA, no differences were seen in FLC levels for different levels of disease activity. Similar results were seen after controlling for renal function, age, and sex. In  multiple linear regression, FLC significantly explained 50% variance of the SLEDAI after adjusting for renal function, age, and sex. CONCLUSION: Serum FLC levels correlate strongly with disease activity in SLE, but not in RA. Serum FLC  may be used as a biomarker of SLE disease activity.";2010-2012
53;Pregnane progestin contraception in systemic lupus erythematosus: a longitudinal  study of 187 patients.;2011;Contraception;Chabbert-Buffet N;BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affects women of child-bearing age. Combined oral contraceptives can worsen the course and increase the risk of  thrombosis. The objectives of this study were to provide an alternative contraception and thus evaluate the gynecological tolerability of pregnane progestins (PPs) in SLE patients. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity and vascular tolerance were also reported. STUDY DESIGN: We used two PP with antigonadotropic potencies, chlormadinone acetate (CMA, 10 mg/day) and cyproterone acetate (CPA, 50 mg/day), administered orally for contraception in 187 SLE patients observed for 46+/-34.6 months (mean+/-S.E.), i.e., 6854 women-months. RESULTS: The gynecological tolerability was satisfactory: breakthrough bleeding was reported in 17.7% patients using CPA and 12.6% patients using CMA. No pregnancy was observed in the women followed in this cohort study.  One deep vein thrombosis, one myocardial infarction, and one tibial posterior arterial occlusion were observed, giving an incidence for venous thromboembolism  of 1.39/yearx1000 women (95% CI 0-4.12) and for macroarterial disease an incidence of 2.79/yearx1000 women (95% CI 0-6.65). Disease activity was less than before progestins. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnane progestin contraception is effective and well tolerated, thus providing SLE patients an excellent contraceptive alternative to the currently used methods.;2010-2012

The efficacy and safety of the  fully human monoclonal antibody belimumab (BLyS-specific inhibitor) was assessed  in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus. METHODS: Patients (aged >/=18 years) who were seropositive with scores of at least 6 on the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) were enrolled in a multicentre phase 3 study, which was done in Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and eastern Europe. Patients were randomly assigned by use of a central interactive voice response system in a 1:1:1 ratio to belimumab 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, or placebo by intravenous infusion in 1 h on days 0, 14, and 28, and then every 28 days until 48 weeks, with standard of care. Patients, investigators, study coordinators, and sponsors were masked to treatment assignment. Primary efficacy endpoint was improvement in the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index (SRI) at week 52  (reduction >/=4 points in SELENA-SLEDAI score; no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group [BILAG] A organ domain score and no more than 1 new B organ domain score; and no worsening [<0.3 increase] in Physician's Global Assessment [PGA] score) versus baseline. Method of analysis was by modified intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00424476. FINDINGS: 867 patients were randomly assigned to belimumab 1 mg/kg (n=289) or 10  mg/kg (n=290), or placebo (n=288). 865 were treated and analysed in the belimumab (1 mg/kg, n=288; 10 mg/kg, n=290) and placebo groups (n=287). Significantly higher SRI rates were noted with belimumab 1 mg/kg (148 [51%], odds ratio 1.55 [95% CI 1.10-2.19]; p=0.0129) and 10 mg/kg (167 [58%], 1.83 [1.30-2.59]; p=0.0006) than with placebo (125 [44%]) at week 52. More patients had their SELENA-SLEDAI score reduced by at least 4 points during 52 weeks with belimumab 1 mg/kg (153 [53%], 1.51 [1.07-2.14]; p=0.0189) and 10 mg/kg (169 [58%], 1.71 [1.21-2.41]; p=0.0024) than with placebo (132 [46%]). More patients given belimumab 1 mg/kg (226 [78%], 1.38 [0.93-2.04]; p=0.1064) and 10 mg/kg (236 [81%], 1.62 [1.09-2.42]; p=0.0181) had no new BILAG A or no more than 1 new B flare than did those in the placebo group (210 [73%]). No worsening in PGA score  was noted in more patients with belimumab 1 mg/kg (227 [79%], 1.68 [1.15-2.47]; p=0.0078) and 10 mg/kg (231 [80%], 1.74 [1.18-2.55]; p=0.0048) than with placebo  (199 [69%]). Rates of adverse events were similar in the groups given belimumab 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, and placebo: serious infection was reported in 22 (8%), 13 (4%), and 17 (6%) patients, respectively, and severe or serious hypersensitivity  reactions on an infusion day were reported in two (<1%), two (<1%), and no patients, respectively. No malignant diseases were reported. INTERPRETATION: Belimumab has the potential to be the first targeted biological treatment that is approved specifically for systemic lupus erythematosus, providing a new option for the management of this important prototypic autoimmune disease.

55;The use of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000 to define active disease and minimal clinically meaningful change based on data from a large cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus patients.;2011;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Yee CS;OBJECTIVES: To examine SLEDAI-2000 cut-off scores for definition of active SLE and to determine the sensitivity to change of SLEDAI-2000 for the assessment of SLE disease activity and minimal clinically meaningful changes in score. METHODS: Data from two multi-centre studies were used in the analysis: in a cross-sectional and a longitudinal fashion. At every assessment, data were collected on SLEDAI-2000 and treatment. The cross-sectional analysis with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to examine the appropriate SLEDAI-2000 score to define active disease and increase in therapy was the reference standard. In the longitudinal analysis, sensitivity to change of SLEDAI-2000 was assessed with multinomial logistic regression. ROC curves analysis was used to examine possible cut-points in score changes associated with change in therapy, and mean changes were estimated. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analysis, the most appropriate cut-off scores for active disease  were 3 or 4. In the longitudinal analysis, the best model for predicting treatment increase was with the change in SLEDAI-2000 score and the score from the previous visit as continuous variables. The use of cut-points was less predictive of treatment change than the use of continuous score. The mean difference in the change in SLEDAI-2000 scores, adjusted for prior score, between patients with treatment increase and those without was 2.64 (95% CI 2.16, 3.14).  CONCLUSIONS: An appropriate SLEDAI-2000 score to define active disease is 3 or 4. SLEDAI-2000 index is sensitive to change. The use of SLEDAI-2000 as a continuous  outcome is recommended for comparative purposes.;2010-2012
56;An assessment of disease flare in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a comparison of BILAG 2004 and the flare version of SELENA.;2011;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Isenberg DA;"AIMS: To compare the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) 2004, the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA) flare index (SFI) and physician's global assessment (PGA) in assessing flares of disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Sixteen patients with active SLE were assessed by a panel of 16 rheumatologists.  The order in which the patients were seen was randomised using a 4x4 Latin square design. Each patient's flare status was determined at each assessment using the BILAG 2004 activity index; the SFI and a PGA. A group of five specialists designated each patient into severe, moderate, mild or no flare categories. RESULTS: The rate of complete agreement (95% CI) of the four individual examining physicians for any flare versus no flare was 81% (55% to 94%), 75% (49% to 90%) and 75% (49% to 90%) for the BILAG 2004 index, SELENA flare instrument and PGA, respectively. The overall agreement between flare defined by BILAG 2004 and the SFI was 81% and when type of flare was considered was 52%. Intraclass correlation coefficients (95% CI), as a measure of internal reliability, were 0.54 (0.32 to 0.78) for BILAG 2004 flare compared with 0.21 (0.08 to 0.48) for SELENA flare and 0.18 (0.06 to 0.45) for PGA. Severe flare was associated with good agreement between the indices but mild/moderate flare was much less consistent. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of flare in patients with SLE is challenging. No flare and severe flare are identifiable but further work is needed to optimise the accurate 'capture' of mild and moderate flares.";2010-2012
57;Insecticide use and risk of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study.;2011;Arthritis care & research;Parks CG;OBJECTIVE: Farming and agricultural pesticide use has been associated with 2 autoimmune rheumatic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, risk associated with other residential or work place insecticide use is unknown. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (n=76,861 postmenopausal women, ages 50-79  years). Incident cases (n=213: 178 for RA, 27 for SLE, and 8 for both) were identified based on self-report and use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs  at year 3 of followup. We examined self-reported residential or work place insecticide use (personally mixing/applying by self and application by others) in relation to RA/SLE risk, overall and in relation to farm history. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were adjusted for age, race, region, education, occupation, smoking, reproductive factors, asthma, other autoimmune diseases, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Compared with never used, personal use of insecticides was associated with increased RA/SLE risk, with significant trends for greater frequency (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.17-3.56 for >/=6 times/year) and duration (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.20-3.23 for >/=20 years). Risk was also associated with long-term insecticide application by others (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.07-3.20 for >/=20 years) and frequent application by others among women with a farm history (HR 2.73, 95% CI 1.10-6.78 for >/=6 times/year). CONCLUSION: These results suggest residential and work place insecticide exposure is associated with the risk of autoimmune rheumatic diseases in postmenopausal women. Although these findings require replication in other populations, they support a role for environmental pesticide exposure in the development of autoimmune rheumatic diseases.;2010-2012
58;Quantification of regulatory T cells in peripheral blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2011;Rheumatology international;Habibagahi M;Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are supposed to stop immune responses in the course of immune activation. However, chronic activation of immune system in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and many other autoreactive disorders are evidence of malfunction of this system. Therefore, it is plausible to quantify presence of these cells in different diseases. Forty-one patients with diagnosis of SLE were  enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into two groups of patients with active and inactive disease based on the disease activity score. Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the frequency of regulatory T cells in peripheral  blood according to high expression of CD25 and intracellular Forkhead/winged-helix (Foxp3). Further 30 healthy individuals considered as control group. Significantly less CD4+CD25hi regulatory T cells were detected in  active patients (P < 0.001) compared to healthy individuals. The percentage of CD4+CD25hi cells were inversely correlated with the SLEDAI disease score in patients with active disease (r = -0.837, P < 0.0001). Patients with active disease had lower frequencies of CD4+Foxp3+ cells. However, increased frequencies of CD4+Foxp3+ T cells were observed in peripheral blood of patients with inactive disease compared with active patients or healthy individuals (P < 0.010). Moreover, a significant difference between the proportion of CD4+CD25-Foxp3+ population in healthy controls and patients with active disease was shown (P < 0.0005). Presence of lower frequencies of Tregs in patients with SLE could be evaluated as an immune turbulence and could be employed as a target for immunotherapeutic manipulation. However, controversies need to be resolved.;2010-2012
59;Single center prospective study of tacrolimus efficacy and safety in the treatment of various manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2011;Rheumatology international;Suzuki K;The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus (TAC) in various manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  patients in daily clinical practice. Each of the 21 TAC-treated patients with SLE in our care over 2 years was enrolled in this open-label trial. Patients were administered TAC at a dosage of 1-6 mg once daily, followed up for 24 weeks. Efficacy and safety were evaluated utilizing clinical and laboratory findings. As treatment targets, TAC was preferentially used with oral corticosteroid administration for mild active manifestations such as arthritis, skin eruptions,  or asymptomatic nephritis. In efficacy, the mean value of the SLE disease activity index was significantly reduced to 4.1, 2.7, 1.8, and 1.2 (N=21, 20, 16  and 13) at 0, 4, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively. In eight cases, treatment was discontinued within 24 weeks due to insufficient effects (6 cases) and side effects (2 cases). Non-serious side effects were observed in only five cases (23.8%) over 24 weeks. TAC can be considered both effective and safe for the treatment of various manifestations of SLE.;2010-2012
60;Serum concentrations of 25-OH vitamin D in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are inversely related to disease activity: is it time to routinely supplement patients with SLE with vitamin D?;2010;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Amital H;BACKGROUND: Low serum vitamin D concentrations have been reported in several autoimmune disorders. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether low serum vitamin D concentrations are related to disease activity of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: 378 patients from several European and Israeli cohorts were pooled and their disease activity was measured by two different methods: 278 patients had SLE disease activity-2000 (SLEDAI-2K) scores and 100 patients had European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement (ECLAM) scores. In order to combine the two systems the scores were converted into standardised values (z-scores), enabling univariate summary statistics for the two variables (SLEDAI-2K and ECLAM). The commercial kit, LIAISON 25-OH vitamin D assay (310900-Diasorin) was used to measure serum concentration of 25-OH vitamin D in 378 patients with SLE. RESULTS: A significant negative correlation was demonstrated between the serum concentration of vitamin D and the standardised values (z-scores) of disease activity scores as measured by the SLEDAI-2K and ECLAM scales (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=-0.12, p=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients with SLE originating from Israel and Europe vitamin D serum concentrations were found to be inversely related to disease activity.;2010-2012
61;Laboratory markers of cardiovascular risk in pediatric SLE: the APPLE baseline cohort.;2010;Lupus;Ardoin SP;As part of the Atherosclerosis Prevention in Pediatric Lupus Erythematosus (APPLE) Trial, a prospective multicenter cohort of 221 children and adolescents with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (mean age 15.7 years, 83% female) underwent baseline measurement of markers of cardiovascular risk, including fasting levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL),  triglycerides (TG), lipoprotein A (Lpa), homocysteine and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). A cross-sectional analysis of the baseline laboratory values and clinical characteristics of this cohort was performed. Univariable relationships between the cardiovascular markers of interest and clinical variables were assessed, followed by multivariable linear regression modeling. Mean levels of LDL, HDL, Lpa, TG, hs-CRP and homocysteine were in the normal or borderline ranges. In multivariable analysis, increased Systemic Lupus  Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), prednisone dose, and hypertension  (HTN) were independently associated with higher LDL levels. Higher hs-CRP and creatinine clearance were independently related to lower HDL levels. Higher body  mass index (BMI), prednisone dose, and homocysteine levels were independently associated with higher TG levels. Only Hispanic or non-White status predicted higher Lpa levels. Proteinuria, higher TG and lower creatinine clearance were independently associated with higher homocysteine levels, while use of multivitamin with folate predicted lower homocysteine levels. Higher BMI, lower HDL, and longer SLE disease duration, but not SLEDAI, were independently associated with higher hs-CRP levels. The R(2) for these models ranged from 7% to 23%. SLE disease activity as measured by the SLEDAI was associated only with higher LDL levels and not with hs-CRP. Markers of renal injury (HTN, proteinuria, and creatinine clearance) were independently associated with levels of LDL, HDL,  and homocysteine, highlighting the importance of renal status in the cardiovascular health of children and adolescents with SLE. Future longitudinal analysis of the APPLE cohort is needed to further examine these relationships.;2010-2012

63;Atorvastatin therapy reduces interferon-regulated chemokine CXCL9 plasma levels in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2010;Lupus;Ferreira GA;"A recent study showed transcriptional levels of interferon-inducible chemokines in peripheral blood cells were associated with disease activity and organ damage  in systemic lupus erythematosus, and may be useful in monitoring disease activity and prognosis. Our objective was to evaluate the capacity of atorvastatin to reduce plasma levels of interferon-regulated chemokines (CCL2, CCL3 and CXCL9) and to study the correlation between these chemokines and disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Eighty-eight female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were divided into two groups: 64 receiving 20 mg/day of atorvastatin (intervention group) and 24 without atorvastatin (control group). All patients were followed for 8 weeks. At baseline and after 8 weeks laboratory  tests were performed for all patients. Plasma levels of chemokines were measured  by ELISA using commercial kits (DuoSet, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). In a univariate analysis we found correlation between CCL2, CCL3 and CXCL9 plasma levels and SLEDAI score. In the intervention group we observed a significant decrease in CXCL9 plasma levels comparing baseline and levels at the end of the study (p = 0.04); however, no differences were observed regarding CCL2 or CCL3 plasma levels in this study. No significant difference was observed in the plasma levels of these chemokines in the control group. We conclude that treatment with  atorvastatin was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma levels of CXCL9 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. As the plasma levels of CXCL9 correlated with the SLEDAI score, we ask whether reducing levels of this chemokine could help to control systemic lupus erythematosus activity.";2010-2012
64;Polymorphisms in the Hsp70 gene locus are genetically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2010;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Furnrohr BG;BACKGROUND: Heat shock proteins (Hsps) play a role in the delivery and presentation of antigenic peptides and are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of multifactorial diseases. OBJECTIVE: To investigate genes encoding cytosolic Hsp70 proteins for associations of allelic variants with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Case-control studies of two independent Caucasian SLE cohorts were performed. In a haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphism approach, common variants of HspA1L, HspA1A and HspA1B were genotyped and principal component analyses were performed for the cohort from the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF). Relative quantification of mRNA was carried out for each Hsp70 gene in healthy controls. Conditional regression analysis was  performed to determine if allelic variants in Hsp70 act independently of HLA-DR3. RESULTS: On analysis of common genetic variants of HspA1L, HspA1A and HspA1B, a haplotype significantly associated with SLE in the Erlangen-SLE cohort was identified, which was confirmed in the OMRF cohort. Depending on the cohorts, OR  ranging from 1.43 to 1.88 and 2.64 to 3.16 was observed for individuals heterozygous and homozygous for the associated haplotype, respectively. Patients  carrying the risk haplotype or the risk allele more often displayed autoantibodies to Ro and La in both cohorts. In healthy controls bearing this haplotype, the amount of HspA1A mRNA was significantly increased, whereas total Hsp70 protein concentration was not altered. CONCLUSIONS: Allelic variants of the Hsp70 genes are significantly associated with SLE in Caucasians, independently of HLA-DR3, and correlate with the presence of autoantibodies to Ro and La. Hence, the Hsp70 gene locus appears to be involved in SLE pathogenesis. AD  - Nikolaus-Fiebiger Centre of Molecular Medicine, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany.;2010-2012
65;The BILAG multi-centre open randomized controlled trial comparing ciclosporin vs  azathioprine in patients with severe SLE.;2010;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Griffiths B;"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether low-dose ciclosporin was a more effective corticosteroid-sparing agent than AZA in patients with SLE. METHODS: Patients with SLE requiring a change or initiation of a corticosteroid-sparing agent and who were taking > or =15 mg of prednisolone/day were randomized to receive either ciclosporin or AZA during this 12-month open-label multi-centre trial. There were strict guidelines for the reduction of prednisolone. The primary outcome was the  absolute mean change in prednisolone. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were randomized. Using an intention-to-treat analysis, the absolute mean change in prednisolone dose between baseline and 12 months, adjusted for baseline prednisolone dose, was 9.0 mg for ciclosporin (95% CI 7.2, 10.8) and 10.7 mg for  AZA (95% CI 8.8, 12.7). The difference in the change between treatment groups was -1.7 mg (95% CI -4.4, 0.9; P = 0.2). No significant differences were detected for the secondary outcomes: change in disease activity [classic British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) index], number of flares, development of new damage or change in quality of life. A similar number of patients in each arm stopped the study drugs due to adverse events and ineffectiveness. No patient developed severe hypertension or a persistent rise in creatinine. One patient in the ciclosporin arm developed a significant increase in proteinuria due to disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: Both drugs were effective corticosteroid-sparing agents. Ciclosporin was not a more effective corticosteroid-sparing agent. Ciclosporin may be considered in patients who are unable to tolerate AZA. Patients on ciclosporin require close monitoring of blood pressure and creatinine. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials, http://www.controlled-trials.com/, ISRCTN35919612.";2010-2012
66;Assessment of cognitive function in systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis by computerized neuropsychological tests.;2010;Arthritis and rheumatism;Hanly JG;OBJECTIVE: Computerized neuropsychological testing may facilitate screening for cognitive impairment in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study was undertaken to compare patients with SLE, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) with healthy controls using the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM). METHODS: Patients with SLE (n = 68), RA (n = 33), and MS (n = 20) were compared with healthy controls (n = 29). Efficiency of cognitive performance on 8 ANAM subtests was examined using  throughput (TP), inverse efficiency (IE), and adjusted IE scores. The latter is more sensitive to higher cognitive functions because it adjusts for the impact of simple reaction time on performance. The results were analyzed using O'Brien's generalized least squares test. RESULTS: Control subjects were the most efficient in cognitive performance. MS patients were least efficient overall (as assessed by TP and IE scores) and were less efficient than both SLE patients (P = 0.01) and RA patients (P < 0.01), who did not differ. Adjusted IE scores were similar between SLE patients, RA patients, and controls, reflecting the impact of simple  reaction time on cognitive performance. Thus, 50% of SLE patients, 61% of RA patients, and 75% of MS patients had impaired performance on >or=1 ANAM subtest.  Only 9% of RA patients and 11% of SLE patients had impaired performance on >or=4  subtests, whereas this was true for 20% of MS patients. CONCLUSION: ANAM is sensitive to cognitive impairment. While such computerized testing may be a valuable screening tool, our results emphasize the lack of specificity of slowed  performance as a reliable indicator of impairment of higher cognitive function in SLE patients.;2010-2012
67;Prospective analysis of neuropsychiatric events in an international disease inception cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2010;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Hanly JG;OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency, accrual, attribution and outcome of neuropsychiatric (NP) events and impact on quality of life over 3 years in a large inception cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: The study was conducted by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics. Patients were enrolled within 15 months of SLE diagnosis.  NP events were identified using the American College of Rheumatology case definitions, and decision rules were derived to determine the proportion of NP disease attributable to SLE. The outcome of NP events was recorded and patient-perceived impact determined by the SF-36. RESULTS: 1206 patients (89.6% female) with a mean (+/-SD) age of 34.5+/-13.2 years were included in the study.  The mean disease duration at enrollment was 5.4+/-4.2 months. Over a mean follow-up of 1.9+/-1.2 years, 486/1206 (40.3%) patients had > or =1 NP events, which were attributed to SLE in 13.0-23.6% of patients using two a priori decision rules. The frequency of individual NP events varied from 47.1% (headache) to 0% (myasthenia gravis). The outcome was significantly better for those NP events attributed to SLE, especially if they occurred within 1.5 years of the diagnosis of SLE. Patients with NP events, regardless of attribution, had  significantly lower summary scores for both mental and physical health over the study. CONCLUSIONS: NP events in patients with SLE are of variable frequency, most commonly present early in the disease course and adversely impact patients'  quality of life over time. Events attributed to non-SLE causes are more common than those due to SLE, although the latter have a more favourable outcome.;2010-2012
68;Risk factors for clinical coronary heart disease in systemic lupus erythematosus: the lupus and atherosclerosis evaluation of risk (LASER) study.;2010;The Journal of rheumatology;Haque S;"OBJECTIVE: Accelerated atherosclerosis and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) are recognized complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the exact etiology remains unclear and is likely to be multifactorial. We hypothesized that SLE patients with CHD have increased exposure to traditional risk factors as well as differing disease phenotype and therapy-related factors compared to SLE patients free of CHD. Our aim was to examine risk factors for development of clinical CHD in SLE in the clinical setting. METHODS: In a UK-wide multicenter retrospective case-control study we recruited 53 SLE patients with verified clinical CHD (myocardial infarction or angina pectoris) and 96 SLE patients without clinical CHD. Controls were recruited from the same center as the case and matched by disease duration. Charts were reviewed up to time of event for cases, or the same ""dummy-date"" in controls. RESULTS: SLE patients with clinical  CHD were older at the time of event [mean (SD) 53 (10) vs 42 (10) yrs; p < 0.001], more likely to be male [11 (20%) vs 3 (7%); p < 0.001], and had more exposure to all classic CHD risk factors compared to SLE patients without clinical CHD. They were also more likely to have been treated with corticosteroids (OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.03, 5.88) and azathioprine (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.16, 4.67) and to have evidence of damage on the pre-event SLICC damage index (SDI) (OR 2.20; 95% CI 1.09, 4.44). There was no difference between groups with regard to clinical organ involvement or autoantibody profile. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the need for clinical vigilance to identify modifiable risk factors in the clinical setting and in particular with male patients. The pattern of organ involvement did not differ in SLE patients with CHD events. However, the higher pre-event SDI, azathioprine exposure, and pattern of damage items (disease-related rather than therapy-related) in cases suggests that a persistent active lupus phenotype contributes to CHD risk. In this regard, corticosteroids and azathioprine may not control disease well enough to prevent CHD. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether classic risk factor modification will have a role in primary prevention of CHD in SLE patients and whether new therapies that control disease activity can better reduce CHD risk.";2010-2012
69;Effects of dehydroepiandrosterone on fatigue and well-being in women with quiescent systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomised controlled trial.;2010;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Hartkamp A;OBJECTIVE: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been reported to improve fatigue and reduced well-being. Both are major problems in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), even with quiescent disease. Low serum DHEA levels are common in SLE. The present work investigates the effects of DHEA administration on fatigue, well-being and functioning in women with inactive SLE. METHODS: In a  double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study, 60 female patients with inactive SLE received 200 mg oral DHEA or placebo. Primary outcome measures were  general fatigue, depressive mood, mental well-being and physical functioning. Assessments were made before treatment, after 3, 6 and 12 months on medication, and 6 months after cessation of treatment. RESULTS: Patients from the DHEA and placebo group improved on general fatigue (p<0.001) and mental well-being (p=0.04). There was no differential effect of DHEA. The belief that DHEA had been used was a stronger predictor for improvement of general fatigue than the actual  use of DHEA (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The trial does not indicate an effect of daily 200 mg oral DHEA on fatigue and well-being, and therefore DHEA treatment is not recommended in unselected female patients with quiescent SLE.

70;Tocilizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus: data on safety, preliminary efficacy, and impact on circulating plasma cells from an open-label phase I dosage-escalation study.;2010;Arthritis and rheumatism;Illei GG;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety of interleukin-6 receptor inhibition and to collect preliminary data on the clinical and immunologic efficacy of tocilizumab  in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: In an open-label phase I dosage-escalation study, 16 patients with mild-to-moderate disease activity were assigned to receive 1 of 3 doses of tocilizumab given intravenously every other week for 12 weeks (total of 7 infusions): 2 mg/kg in 4 patients, 4 mg/kg in 6 patients, or 8 mg/kg in 6 patients. Patients were then monitored for an additional 8 weeks. RESULTS: The infusions were well tolerated. Tocilizumab treatment led to dosage-related decreases in the absolute neutrophil count, with  a median decrease of 38% in the 4 mg/kg dosage group and 56% in the 8 mg/kg dosage group. Neutrophil counts returned to normal after cessation of treatment.  One patient was withdrawn from the study because of neutropenia. Infections occurred in 11 patients; none was associated with neutropenia. Disease activity showed significant improvement, with a decrease of > or =4 points in the modified Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment version of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index score in 8 of the 15 evaluable patients. Arthritis improved in all 7 patients who had arthritis at baseline and resolved in 4 of them. Levels of anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies decreased by a median of 47% in patients in the 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg dosage groups, with a 7.8% decrease in their IgG levels. These changes, together with a  significant decrease in the frequency of circulating plasma cells, suggest a specific effect of tocilizumab on autoantibody-producing cells. CONCLUSION: Although neutropenia may limit the maximum dosage of tocilizumab in patients with SLE, the observed clinical and serologic responses are promising and warrant further studies to establish the optimal dosing regimen and efficacy.";2010-2012

METHODS: Seventeen patients with SLE who were enrolled in a clinical trial of belimumab, a BLyS-specific inhibitor, plus standard of care therapy were studied. Phenotypic analysis of lymphocytes was performed using flow cytometry. Circulating antibody-secreting cells were enumerated using enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Serum was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an antibody that recognizes products of the V(H)4-34 gene. Lymphocyte counts, Ig levels, and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody levels were available as part of the clinical trial analyses. RESULTS: Samples were collected on days 0, 84, 168, 365, and 532 and after day 730. The total number of B cells started to decrease from baseline between days 84 and 168. This was due to a decrease in naive and transitional B cells. CD27+IgD+ memory B cells and plasmablasts decreased only after 532 days, whereas CD27+IgD-  memory B cells were not affected, and there were no changes in T cells. Serum IgM levels began to decline between days 84 and 168, but there were no changes in serum levels of IgG, IgG anti-DNA antibodies, or V(H)4-34 antibodies during the study. SLE patients had more IgM-, IgG-, and autoantibody-producing B cells than  did normal controls on day 0. There was only a modest decrease in the frequency of total IgM-producing, but not IgG-producing, cells on days 365 and 532, consistent with the phenotypic and serologic data. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the dependence of newly formed B cells on BLyS for survival in humans. In contrast, memory B cells and plasma cells are less susceptible to selective BLyS  inhibition.;2010-2012
72;Toward the development of criteria for global flares in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus.;2010;Arthritis care & research;Brunner HI;"OBJECTIVE: To develop a definition of global flare in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and derive candidate criteria for measuring juvenile SLE flares. METHODS: Pediatric rheumatologists answered 2 Delphi questionnaires to achieve consensus on a common definition of juvenile SLE flare and identify variables for use in candidate flare criteria. The diagnostic accuracy of these candidate flare criteria was tested with data from juvenile SLE patients (n = 98; 623 visits total). Physician-rated change in the juvenile SLE course (worsening,  yes/no) between visits served as the criterion standard. RESULTS: There was 96% consensus that a ""a flare is a measurable worsening of juvenile SLE disease activity in at least one organ system, involving new or worse signs of disease that may be accompanied by new or worse SLE symptoms. Depending on the severity of the flare, more intensive therapy may be required."" Variables suggested for use in flare criteria were: physician-rated disease activity (V1), patient well-being, protein:creatinine ratio, a validated disease activity index (V2), the Child Health Questionnaire physical summary score (V3), anti-double-stranded  DNA antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and complement levels. Using multiple logistic regression, several candidate flare criteria were derived with  area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as high as 0.92 (sensitivity >or=85%, specificity >or=85%); classification and regression tree analysis suggested that V1, V2, and V3 suffice to identify juvenile SLE flares (AUC 0.81; sensitivity = 64%, specificity = 86%). CONCLUSION: Consensus about a definition of global disease flare for juvenile SLE has been obtained and promising candidate flare criteria have been developed. These will need further assessment of their ease of use and accuracy in prospective study.";2010-2012

74;Prevalence of human papilloma virus infections and cervical cytological abnormalities among Korean women with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2010;Journal of Korean medical science;Lee YH;We performed a multicenter cross-sectional study of 134 sexually active systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients to investigate the prevalence of and risk factors for high risk human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and cervical cytological abnormalities among Korean women with SLE. In this multicenter cross-sectional study, HPV testing and routine cervical cytologic examination was performed. HPV was typed using a hybrid method or the polymerase chain reaction.  Data on 4,595 healthy women were used for comparison. SLE patients had greater prevalence of high-risk HPV infection (24.6% vs. 7.9%, P<0.001, odds ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval 2.5-5.7) and of abnormal cervical cytology (16.4 vs. 2.8%, P<0.001, OR 4.4, 95% CI 2.5-7.8) compared with controls. SLE itself was identified as independent risk factors for high risk HPV infection among Korean women (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.5-5.7) along with >/=2 sexual partners (OR 8.5, 95% CI 1.2-61.6), and Pap smear abnormalities (OR 97.3, 95% CI 6.5-1,456.7). High-risk HPV infection and cervical cytological abnormalities were more common among Korean women with SLE than controls. SLE itself may be a risk factor for HPV infection among Korean women, suggesting the importance of close monitoring of HPV infections and abnormal Pap smears in SLE patients.;2010-2012
75;Ibandronate increases cortical bone density in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus on long-term glucocorticoid.;2010;Arthritis research & therapy;Li EK;"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this research is to assess the effects of oral ibandronate on bone microarchitecture by using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) taking a long-term glucocorticoid. METHODS: In this double-blind placebo-controlled study, 40 Chinese female SLE patients taking prednisolone were randomly assigned to receive either monthly oral ibandronate (150 mg) or placebo with daily 1-hydroxycholecalciferol (Alfacalcidol; 1 mug) and calcium supplement for 12 months. Assessments of bone microarchitecture by using  HR-pQCT and area bone mineral density (aBMD) of the lumbar spine and hip with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were performed at baseline and 12 months.  RESULTS: No differences in baseline characteristics were found between the two groups. After 12 months, no statistical differences were noted in any of the bone densities, microarchitectural parameters, or percentage changes of these parameters, as measured with HR-pQCT or DXA between the two groups. However, within the active group, the percentage improvement was significant in cortical bone density (P = 0.023) which was absent in the placebo group. Improvement was also seen in the aBMD of both the lumbar spine (P < 0.0001) and the hip (P < 0.005). In the placebo group, the percentage increase in trabecular separation was significant (P = 0.04), and the percentage improvement in aBMD in the spine also was significant (P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Oral ibandronate treatment improves microarchitecture in SLE patients taking long-term glucocorticoid assessed with HR-pQCT, and this new technology may have a role in assessing bony  changes in future longitudinal studies in SLE patients.

77;Promoter insertion/deletion in the IRF5 gene is highly associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus in distinct populations, but exerts a modest effect on gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.;2010;The Journal of rheumatology;Lofgren SE;OBJECTIVE: We examined the genetic association of the promoter insertion/deletion (indel) in IRF5 gene with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in distinct populations and assessed its role in gene expression. METHODS: Four IRF5 polymorphisms were genotyped in 1488 SLE patients and 1466 controls. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). RESULTS: The promoter indel and rs2070197 had independent genetic effects, which accounted for the association of rs2004640 and rs10954213. Gene expression analysis revealed that rs10954213 exerted the greatest influence on IRF5 transcript levels. CONCLUSION: We corroborated the association of the promoter indel with SLE in 5 different populations and revealed that rs10954213 is the main single-nucleotide polymorphism responsible for altered IRF5 expression in PBMC.;2010-2012
78;Effects of prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone) on markers of cardiovascular risk  and bone turnover in premenopausal women with systemic lupus erythematosus: a pilot study.;2010;Lupus;Marder W;"DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a weak androgen with proposed efficacy in the treatment of mild to moderate lupus, and possible beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk and bone mineral density. We hypothesized that treatment with 200 mg a day of Prasterone (DHEA) would improve pre-clinical measures of atherosclerosis: flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation (NMD), and circulating apoptotic endothelial cells (CD 146(AnnV +)), as well markers of bone metabolism. Thirteen premenopausal female patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) <or=8 were enrolled  in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial for 22 weeks with a 6-week washout between treatment periods. Results reveal high-density lipoprotein (HDL)  levels significantly decreased with Prasterone (48.5 versus 56.3 with placebo, p  <or= 0.001), and there was a trend towards impairment of endothelial function with Prasterone (brachial artery FMD 3.4% versus 4.4% with placebo, mean difference -1.07, NMD 19.5% versus 24.4% with placebo, mean difference -4.9, p =  NS). There were no differences between groups in SLEDAI, CD146( AnnV+) cells, or  receptor activator for nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin, although RANKL was higher after treatment with Prasterone (mean difference -29.5 units; p  = 0.097). This pilot study does not support the use of Prasterone in mild lupus for prevention of atherosclerosis or osteoporosis, and confirms other findings of potentially harmful effects on lipids.";2010-2012
79;The efficacy and safety of abatacept in patients with non-life-threatening manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus: results of a twelve-month, multicenter, exploratory, phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.;2010;Arthritis and rheumatism;Merrill JT;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate abatacept therapy in patients with non-life-threatening systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and polyarthritis, discoid lesions, or pleuritis and/or pericarditis. METHODS: In a 12-month, multicenter, exploratory,  phase IIb randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, SLE patients with polyarthritis, discoid lesions, or pleuritis and/or pericarditis were randomized  at a ratio of 2:1 to receive abatacept ( approximately 10 mg/kg of body weight) or placebo. Prednisone (30 mg/day or equivalent) was given for 1 month, and then  the dosage was tapered. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with new flare (adjudicated) according to a score of A/B on the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) index after the start of the steroid taper. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were randomized to receive abatacept and 57 to receive placebo. The baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. The proportion of new BILAG A/B flares over 12 months was 79.7% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 72.4, 86.9) in the abatacept group and 82.5% (95% CI 72.6, 92.3) in the placebo group (treatment difference -3.5 [95% CI -15.3, 8.3]). Other prespecified flare end points were not met. In post hoc analyses, the proportions of abatacept-treated and placebo-treated patients with a BILAG A flare were 40.7% (95% CI 31.8, 49.5) versus 54.4% (95% CI 41.5, 67.3), and the proportions with physician-assessed flare were 63.6% (95% CI 54.9, 72.2) and 82.5% (95% CI 72.6, 92.3), respectively; treatment differences were greatest in the polyarthritis group. Prespecified exploratory patient-reported outcomes (Short Form 36 health survey, sleep problems, fatigue) demonstrated a treatment effect with abatacept.  The frequency of adverse events (AEs) was comparable in the abatacept and placebo groups (90.9% versus 91.5%), but serious AEs (SAEs) were higher in the abatacept  group (19.8 versus 6.8%). Most SAEs were single, disease-related events occurring during the first 6 months of the study (including the steroid taper period). CONCLUSION: Although the primary/secondary end points were not met in this study, improvements in certain exploratory measures suggest some abatacept efficacy in patients with non-life-threatening manifestations of SLE. The increased rate of SAEs requires further assessment.";2010-2012
80;Efficacy and safety of rituximab in moderately-to-severely active systemic lupus  erythematosus: the randomized, double-blind, phase II/III systemic lupus erythematosus evaluation of rituximab trial.;2010;Arthritis and rheumatism;Merrill JT;OBJECTIVE: B cells are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and rituximab induces depletion of B cells. The Exploratory  Phase II/III SLE Evaluation of Rituximab (EXPLORER) trial tested the efficacy and safety of rituximab versus placebo in patients with moderately-to-severely active extrarenal SLE. METHODS: Patients entered with >or=1 British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A score or >or=2 BILAG B scores despite background immunosuppressant therapy, which was continued during the trial. Prednisone was added and subsequently tapered. Patients were randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to receive rituximab (1,000 mg) or placebo on days 1, 15, 168, and 182. RESULTS: In  the intent-to-treat analysis of 257 patients, background treatment was evenly distributed among azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and methotrexate. Fifty-three percent of the patients had >or=1 BILAG A score at entry, and 57% of  the patients were categorized as being steroid dependent. No differences were observed between placebo and rituximab in the primary and secondary efficacy end  points, including the BILAG-defined response, in terms of both area under the curve and landmark analyses. A beneficial effect of rituximab on the primary end  point was observed in the African American and Hispanic subgroups. Safety and tolerability were similar in patients receiving placebo and those receiving rituximab. CONCLUSION: The EXPLORER trial enrolled patients with moderately-to-severely active SLE and used aggressive background treatment and sensitive cutoffs for nonresponse. No differences were noted between placebo and  rituximab in the primary and secondary end points. Further evaluation of patient  subsets, biomarkers, and exploratory outcome models may improve the design of future SLE clinical trials.;2010-2012
81;Therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolate mofetil and enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2010;Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy;Djabarouti S;OBJECTIVE: Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active form of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS), is used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). MMF and EC-MPS pharmacokinetics were examined to devise guidance for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for SLE patients with normal renal function. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This observational study included 21 patients receiving MMF (1000 mg twice daily) and 14 taking EC-MPS (720 mg twice daily). MPA AUC between 0 and 12 h (AUC(0-12h)), C(max), T(max), and 12-h trough concentrations (C(12h)) were determined. RESULTS: Means of dose-normalized MMF- or EC-MPS-MPA C(max) were 64.6 +/- 25 and 61.4 +/- 27.1 h mg/l, respectively. MPA T(max) for EC-MPS was longer and more variable than for MMF. MMF-MPA AUC(0-12h) and C(12h) were correlated (r = 0.78, p = 0.0001), but EC-MPS-MPA C(max) and single concentrations were weakly correlated. A limited-sampling strategy (LSS) combining C(max) and C(12h) gave satisfactory predictive performance to estimate MPA AUC(0-12h) after EC-MPS administration. CONCLUSIONS: For TDM in SLE patients with GFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), C(12h) after MMF ingestion could predict MPA AUC(0-12h), while an LSS around T(max) should be  used for patients on EC-MPS. ;2010-2012
82;C1-inhibitor autoantibodies in SLE.;2010;Lupus;Meszaros T;The presence of anti-C1-inhibitor (anti-C1-INH) autoantibodies is a hallmark of acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency. However, only scarce data are available on their prevalence, diagnostic value, and/or significance in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In a multicentre study, we determined the levels of autoantibodies to C1-inhibitor in sera from 202 patients with SLE and 134 healthy controls. Additional clinical and laboratory parameters, such as organ involvement, as well as anti-C1q, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, erythrocyte  sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, C3 and C4 serum complement levels have been studied in patients. The level of anti-C1-INH IgG was significantly higher (p = 0.034) in SLE patients, than in the controls. A high anti-C1-INH level of >  or =0.4 U/ml (mean of controls + 2 SD) was found in 17% of the patients, but in only 4% of the controls (p = 0.0003). The SLEDAI score was significantly higher (p = 0.048) and the duration of SLE was significantly longer (p = 0.0004) among patients with elevated anti-C1-INH levels compared with patients without this autoantibody (median disease duration 8 vs. 17 years, respectively). Anti-C1-INH  level was not correlated with any other laboratory parameter or organ manifestation of the disease. These findings indicate that the anti-C1-INH level  is higher in SLE patients than in healthy controls and furthermore, the anti-C1-INH level correlates with the duration and activity of the disease.;2010-2012
83;Diagnostic reliability of magnetic resonance imaging for central nervous system syndromes in systemic lupus erythematosus: a prospective cohort study.;2010;BMC musculoskeletal disorders;Katsumata Y;"BACKGROUND: Previous studies of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic  tool for central nervous system (CNS) syndromes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) contained several limitations such as study design, number of enrolled patients, and definition of CNS syndromes. We overcame these problems and statistically evaluated the diagnostic values of abnormal MRI signals and their chronological changes in CNS syndromes of SLE. METHODS: We prospectively studied  191 patients with SLE, comparing those with (n = 57) and without (n = 134) CNS syndrome. CNS syndromes were characterized using the American College of Rheumatology case definitions. RESULTS: Any abnormal MRI signals were more frequently observed in subjects in the CNS group (n = 25) than in the non-CNS group (n = 32) [relative risk (RR), 1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.7; p = 0.016] and the positive and negative predictive values for the diagnosis of CNS syndrome were 42% and 76%, respectively. Large abnormal MRI signals (o >or= 10 mm) were seen only in the CNS group (n = 7; RR, 3.7; CI, 2.9-4.7; p = 0.0002), whereas small abnormal MRI signals (o < 10 mm) were seen in both groups with no statistical difference. Large signals always paralleled clinical outcome (p = 0.029), whereas small signals did not (p = 1.000). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal MRI signals, which showed statistical associations with CNS syndrome, had insufficient diagnostic values. A large MRI signal was, however, useful as a diagnostic and surrogate marker for CNS syndrome of SLE, although it was less common. ";2010-2012
84;Increased ERK and JNK activities correlate with disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2010;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Molad Y;BACKGROUND: Aberrant signalling along the p21ras/MAP kinase pathway has been demonstrated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether expression and activity of the MAP kinases ERK and JNK reflect disease activity in patients with SLE. METHODS: Blood samples of 42 outpatients with SLE  were prospectively collected during four consecutive visits. The control group included 20 healthy subjects. Disease activity was assessed using the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). Expression of total ERK and JNK kinases and their active forms (pERK and pJNK) was determined in whole protein lysates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: The mean levels of the active kinases pERK and pJNK were significantly increased in patients with active disease (SLEDAI 4-20) as compared with patients with inactive disease (SLEDAI 0-3), p = 0.04, as well as with healthy controls, p = 0.03 and p = 0.003 for pERK and pJNK, respectively. The percentage of activated forms of ERK and JNK of the total expression of these MAP kinases was also gradually increased, reaching 50% for pERK and >40% for pJNK in patients with SLE with moderate-to-severe disease (SLEDAI 7-20), p = 0.005, p  = 0.005 and p = 0.02, p = 0.05 as compared with controls and inactive patients, respectively. A decrease of more than three SLEDAI points was associated with a significant reduction in the expression of both total and activated forms of ERK  and JNK, p = 0.03, p = 0.01, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that ERK and JNK activity reflects disease activity in patients with SLE. These MAP kinases may serve as additional tools for the evaluation of disease activity and  management of these patients.;2010-2012
85;Quality-of-life predictor factors in patients with SLE and their modification after cognitive behavioural therapy.;2010;Lupus;Navarrete-Navarrete N;"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the clinical and psychological factors linked to health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and test the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy in changing these factors. METHODS: We evaluated 34 patients  with SLE over a period of 15 months. In order to study the variables related to items of QOL and the physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summaries of the SF-36, several multiple linear regression models were constructed. Patients were  randomized and distributed into two similar groups; one of them received cognitive behavioural therapy and the other received the usual controlled care. The psychological aspects as well as the related-disease factors were evaluated four times during the study. RESULTS: Self-perceived stress (R(2) corrected: 0.314, t: -2.476, p < 0.021), vulnerability to stress (R(2) corrected: 0.448, T:  -2.166, p < 0.04) and anxiety (R(2) corrected: 0.689, T: -7.294, p < 0.00) were predictor variables of MCS. The group of patients who received the therapy improved their level of physical role functioning, vitality, general health perceptions and mental health, compared with the group of patients who only received conventional care. CONCLUSION: QOL usually depends on multiple factors,  some of which are stress and anxiety, which can be modified by a cognitive behavioural therapy, in order to obtain a significant improvement in the HRQOL, irrespective of the activity level of the disease. Frequent evaluations of the quality of life in patients with SLE and psychological treatment should also be considered.";2010-2012
86;Pharmacokinetics and immunoglobulin response of subcutaneous and intravenous atacicept in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2010;Journal of pharmaceutical sciences;Nestorov I;"Atacicept, a recombinant fusion protein of the TACI receptor and human IgG, is an inhibitor of B-Lymphocyte Stimulator (BLyS) and APRIL, potent stimulators of B cell maturation, proliferation, and survival. Pharmacokinetics (PKs) and biological activity of intravenous (iv) and subcutaneous (sc) atacicept are described here for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in two randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase Ib studies. Study 1: Six cohorts of eight patients received sc atacicept (single dose: 0.3, 1, 3, or 9 mg/kg; four weekly doses: 1 or 3 mg/kg), or placebo (3:1 ratio). Study 2: Four cohorts of six patients received iv atacicept (single dose: 3, 9, or 18 mg/kg; multiple dose: 2  x 9 mg/kg), or matching placebo (5:1 ratio). PK profiles were determined through  serum atacicept and atacicept-BLyS complex, and biological activity through IgA,  IgG, and IgM levels. PK profiles of atacicept were influenced by saturable binding between atacicept and its ligands, and were consistent and predictable across doses and regimens. Atacicept's biological activity was compatible with its presumed mechanism of action. Bioavailability was approximately 30-40% following sc or iv administration and similar doses yielded similar biological activity irrespective of administration route. This observation may have a mechanistic foundation and may inform dosing regimen design for future studies.";2010-2012
87;Association study of TRAF1-C5 polymorphisms with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus in Japanese.;2010;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Nishimoto K;OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the association of polymorphisms of TRAF1-C5, a newly identified rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk locus in Caucasians, with susceptibility to RA and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Japanese populations. Gene expression levels of TRAF1 and C5 to assess the functional significance of genotypes were also analysed. METHODS: A multicentre association study consisting of 4 RA case-control series (4397 cases  and 2857 controls) and 3 SLE case-control series (591 cases and 2199 shared controls) was conducted. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan genotyping assay for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that showed the best evidence of association in the previous Caucasian studies. Quantifications of TRAF1 and C5 expression were performed with TaqMan expression assay. RESULTS: Significant differences in allele frequency for both SNPs were observed between RA and control subjects (combined odds ratio = 1.09), while no significant difference was detected between patients with SLE and controls. Interestingly, alleles rs3761847 A and rs10818488 G had increased the risk for RA in the present study,  while they decreased the risk in the original studies. A significant difference was found between risk allele carriers and non-carriers of rs10818488 for the expression level of TRAF1 in phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated lymphoblastoid  cell lines (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Association of TRAF1-C5 locus with RA susceptibility was detected in the Japanese populations with modest magnitude, while no significant association was observed for SLE. Significant positive effect of genotype on the expression of TRAF1 might support the genetic association between TRAF1 and RA.;2010-2012
88;Efficacy and safety of cyclosporine A in patients with refractory systemic lupus  erythematosus in a daily clinical practice.;2010;Lupus;Ogawa H;"We investigated the efficacy and safety of cyclosporine A (CsA; targeted serum trough level: 80-150 ng/ml) in a daily clinical practice for treating patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), who had been, or were expected to be, refractory to glucocorticoids (GCs) and other immunosuppressants. Fifty-nine patients with SLE receiving CsA were observed for at least 6 months (21.5 months  on average). A significant reduction of proteinuria was noted 2 weeks after initiation of treatment in patients with nephritis, resulting in a clinical response in five of eight patients in the GC dose-up group and 11 of 18 patients  in the stable GC dose group, respectively. Notably, the mean score for disease activity on the SLE Disease Activity Index decreased significantly from 8.6 +/- 5.3 to 4.4 +/- 2.5 after CsA treatment in patients in the stable GC dose group (n = 40). Moreover, the mean flare rate decreased by approximately 60% with CsA. Side effects of CsA appeared in 32.2% of patients and all of them subsided through dose reduction or discontinuation (n=8) of CsA. Consequently, the cumulative 2-year survival rate of CsA was 75%. The results suggest that CsA should be considered for patients with SLE refractory to GCs.";2010-2012
89;Disease activity patterns in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus and its relation to early aggressive treatment.;2010;Lupus;Otten MH;"This study aimed to determine disease activity patterns in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (jSLE) and its relation to early treatment. All jSLE patients who visited the outpatient departments of three Dutch university hospitals for at least 6 months were included. Data were retrospectively collected from each patient visit and hospitalization. Patient characteristics, clinical and laboratory findings categorized in organ systems, flare rate, medication use and  disease course were analysed. Included were 35 patients (female 77%; White 47%) with a total follow-up of 142 years. Median age at diagnosis was 12.8 years. Flare rate was 0.45/ patient-year. An organ system not earlier involved was affected in 34% of flares. Identifiable disease activity patterns were: chronic active (49%), relapse remitting (14%) and long quiescence (37%), with no significant difference in organ involvement at diagnosis. Positive anti-Sm and non-White ethnicity were significantly associated with a chronic active pattern.  In 14 patients with severe symptoms at diagnosis, treatment with intravenous cyclophosphamide and/or biologics and/or intravenous methylprednisone in the first 6 months resulted in a long quiescence pattern in seven patients. In conclusion, distinct disease activity patterns are identifiable in children. Suppression of disease with early aggressive treatment may decrease the rate of progression.";2010-2012
90;Depression and cognitive impairment in newly diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus.;2010;The Journal of rheumatology;Petri M;"OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment is present in 80% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 10 years after diagnosis. The natural history of cognitive dysfunction in newly diagnosed SLE is unknown. We examined the association of depression and cognitive performance in newly diagnosed SLE. METHODS: A multicenter cohort of 111 patients newly diagnosed (within 9 months) with SLE underwent cognitive function testing using an automated battery [Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM)] with 9 subtests. Depression was measured using the Calgary Depression Scale (CDS). RESULTS: The patient cohort was 97.3% female, 55.9% white, 15.3% African American, 20.7% Hispanic, mean age 37.8 years, mean education 15.2 years. CDS score ranged from 0 to 18 (mean 5.0 +/- 4.6). CDS score did not differ by age, sex, ethnicity, or prednisone dose. Higher Krupp Fatigue Severity Scale scores and presence of fibromyalgia were significantly associated with higher CDS score (p < 0.001; p = 0.006, respectively). Depressed patients, defined by a CDS score > 6, had significantly  poorer performance on 5 ANAM throughput measures: code substitution (p = 0.03), continuous performance (p = 0.02), matching-to-sample (p = 0.04), simple reaction time (p = 0.02), and the Sternberg memory test (p = 0.04). Adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, education, and prednisone dose, a higher CDS score remained significantly associated with poorer performance on 3 measures, but the association was slightly attenuated for code substitution and matching-to-sample. Depression was not associated with mathematical or spatial processing. CONCLUSION: Depression, a modifiable risk factor, is associated with significantly poorer function in several cognitive domains in patients newly diagnosed with SLE. Treatment of depression when the CDS score is greater than 6  may improve cognitive functioning and should be further studied.";2010-2012
91;High-dose cyclophosphamide versus monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide for systemic lupus erythematosus: a prospective randomized trial.;2010;Arthritis and rheumatism;Petri M;"OBJECTIVE: Monthly intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide for 6 months has been the standard induction regimen for lupus nephritis, followed by a maintenance regimen of quarterly infusions for 2 years. We undertook this study to compare the efficacy and safety of the standard regimen versus a high-dose IV cyclophosphamide regimen. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized trial comparing monthly IV cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m(2) body surface area for 6 months followed by quarterly IV cyclophosphamide for 2 years (traditional treatment) against high-dose IV cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg daily for 4 days) (high-dose treatment). Entry criteria included renal lupus, neurologic lupus, or  other organ system involvement with moderate-to-severe activity. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were randomized; 3 withdrew before treatment and 1 committed suicide after 2 months of high-dose treatment. Twenty-two had renal lupus, 14 had neurologic lupus, and 11 had other organ involvement. The outcome measure was the Responder Index for Lupus Erythematosus (complete response, partial response, no  change, or worsening). At 6 months (the end of induction), 11 of 21 patients (52%) in the high-dose treatment group had a complete response compared with 9 of 26 patients (35%) in the traditional treatment group (P = 0.13). At the final visit (30 months), 10 of 21 patients (48%) in the high-dose treatment group had a complete response compared with 13 of 20 patients (65%) who continued with traditional treatment (P = 0.13). Six patients crossed over from traditional treatment to high-dose treatment because of lack of response, and 3 of those patients became complete responders. CONCLUSION: There was not strong evidence that monthly IV cyclophosphamide and high-dose IV cyclophosphamide differed in complete or in any (complete or partial) response to induction or maintenance therapy. However, nonresponders to monthly IV cyclophosphamide can sometimes be rescued with high-dose IV cyclophosphamide.";2010-2012
92;European population substructure correlates with systemic lupus erythematosus endophenotypes in North Americans of European descent.;2010;Genes and immunity;Richman IB;Previous work has demonstrated that Northern and Southern European ancestries are associated with specific systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) manifestations. In this study, 1855 SLE cases of European descent were genotyped for 4965 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and principal components analysis of genotype information was used to define population substructure. The first principal component (PC1) distinguished Northern from Southern European ancestry, PC2 differentiated Eastern from Western European ancestry and PC3 delineated Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Compared with Northern European ancestry, Southern European ancestry was associated with autoantibody production (odds ratio (OR)=1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.83) and renal involvement (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.06-1.87), and was protective for discoid rash (OR=0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.82) and photosensitivity (OR=0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.97). Both serositis (OR=1.46, 95% CI 1.12-1.89) and autoantibody production (OR=1.38, 95% CI 1.06-1.80) were associated with Western compared to Eastern European ancestry. Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry was protective against neurologic manifestations of SLE (OR=0.62, 95% CI 0.40-0.94). Homogeneous clusters of cases defined by multiple PCs demonstrated stronger phenotypic associations. Genetic ancestry may contribute to the development of SLE endophenotypes and should be accounted for in genetic studies of disease characteristics.;2010-2012
93;Magnetic resonance imaging of Jaccoud's arthropathy in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2010;Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme;Sa Ribeiro D;OBJECTIVE: To perform a detailed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis of the hands of patients with Jaccoud's arthropathy (JA) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: The hand with more expressive deformities compatible with JA from a group of SLE patients was examined by 1.5-T MRI. The protocol included coronal, sagittal, and axial turbo-spin-echo images before and  after the administration of contrast medium. The presence of synovitis, edema, erosion, cysts, and tenosynovitis in the carpometacarpal, metacarpophalangeal, and proximal interphalangeal joints were scored based on a modified Outcome Measures in Rheumatology recommendations. RESULTS: Twenty SLE patients, (19 women and one man) with median age of 44.7 years (range: 20-76 years), median disease duration of 14.7 years (range: 5-26 years), and median arthritis duration of 13.7 years (range: 4-26 years) were studied. Of the 300 joints evaluated, 202 (67.3%)  had some degree of synovitis. Sixteen out of 300 examined joints (5.3%) small areas of erosion were seen in 10 out of the 20 patients (50%). Subchondral bone edema was found in eight out of the 20 (40%) patients or a total of 18 joints (6%). A total of 200 compartments tendons were evaluated, and changes were found  in 77 (38.5%) of them. In four out of the 20 patients, the MRI revealed bone cysts. CONCLUSIONS: The MRI seems to be a non-invasive diagnostic tool in patients with JA secondary to SLE, and may contribute to understanding the mechanism involved in the development of this deformity.;2010-2012
94;A STAT4 risk allele is associated with ischaemic cerebrovascular events and anti-phospholipid antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2010;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Svenungsson E;OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the risk allele for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 4 (STAT4) gene, defined by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10181656(G), is associated with vascular events and/or presence of prothrombotic anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients with SLE. METHODS: Two independent groups of unrelated patients with SLE of Swedish ethnicity (n=424 and 154) were genotyped, and occurrence of previous manifestations of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD) and venous thromboembolic events (VTE) was tabulated. aPL values were measured by ELISA. Matched controls (n=492 and 194) were genotyped. RESULTS: The STAT4 risk allele was more frequent in patients with SLE with previous arterial events (combined OR (OR(c))=1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0) compared to patients without such events. The association was mainly attributable to an accumulation of the risk allele among patients with ICVD (OR(c)=2.3, CI 1.6 to 3.3). There was no association with IHD  or VTE. The presence of two or more aPLs was associated with the risk allele (OR(c)=1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.0). In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses treatment for hypertension, at least one STAT4 risk allele, older age, IgG anti-cardiolipin antibodies and longer SLE duration remained independently associated with previous ICVD (p<or=0.02 for all). CONCLUSION: Patients with SLE  with the STAT4 risk allele had a strikingly increased risk of ICVD, comparable in magnitude to that of hypertension. The results imply that a genetic predisposition is an important and previously unrecognised risk factor for ICVD in SLE, and that aPLs may be one underlying mechanism.;2010-2012
95;Prognostic impact of atypical presentation in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus: results from a multicenter study.;2010;The Journal of pediatrics;Taddio A;"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to assess the rate of atypical manifestations at onset in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to evaluate their effect on disease outcome. STUDY DESIGN: This is a multicenter retrospective cohort study. A manifestation was considered atypical if it was not included in the American College Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE but was reported in literature as associated with SLE. Unfavorable outcome was considered presence of organ damage in the Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index at the last available evaluation. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled in the study; 24% presented atypical clinical features at onset. Univariate analysis showed a significant association of worse outcome variables with the presence of atypical  manifestations at onset (P = .004), as well as renal involvement (P = .027). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that atypical manifestations at  onset (P = .018), renal involvement at onset or during follow up (P = .024), and  central nervous system disease involvement during follow up (P = .021) were independent predictors of poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a relatively high rate of atypical onset in pediatric SLE. Presence of atypical manifestations at presentation and early kidney disease correlate with poor outcome. Similarly, during follow-up, kidney and central nervous system diseases  are associated with worse outcome.";2010-2012
96;Combination therapy with steroids and mizoribine in juvenile SLE: a randomized controlled trial.;2010;Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany);Tanaka Y;"The initial treatment of childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is not standardized. Although corticosteroids are the first-line therapy for SLE, long-term, high-dose steroid therapy is associated with various side effects in children. The Japanese Study Group for Renal Disease in Children (JSRDC) has carried out a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid and mizoribine (MZB) therapy as an initial treatment for newly diagnosed juvenile SLE. Twenty-eight patients were treated with a combination steroid and MZB (4-5 mg/kg/day) (group S+M) drug therapeutic regimen, while 29 patients were treated with steroid only (group S); both groups were followed up for 1 year. The time to the first flare from treatment initiation was not significantly different between the two groups (Kaplan-Meier method, p = 0.09). During the period when the steroid was given daily (day 0-183), the time to the first flare from treatment initiation was significantly longer in the patients of group S+M than in those of group S (log-rank test, p = 0.02). At the  end of the study period, there were no differences in the severity of proteinuria and renal function impairment between the two groups. No patients dropped out of  the trial due to adverse events. In conclusion, our combined steroid and MZB drug therapeutic regimen was not shown to be significantly better than the steroid-only therapy as initial treatment for juvenile SLE. Whether MZB administered in a higher dose would be therapeutically advantageous can only be answered by further studies.";2010-2012
97;Atherosclerotic vascular events in a multinational inception cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus.;2010;Arthritis care & research;Urowitz MB;OBJECTIVE: To describe vascular events during an 8-year followup in a multicenter systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) inception cohort and their attribution to atherosclerosis. METHODS: Clinical data, including comorbidities, were recorded yearly. Vascular events were recorded and attributed to atherosclerosis or not. All of the events met standard clinical criteria. Factors associated with atherosclerotic vascular events were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and chi-square tests. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association of factors with vascular events attributed to atherosclerosis. RESULTS: Since 2000, 1,249 patients have been entered into the cohort. There have been 97 vascular events in 72 patients, including: myocardial  infarction (n = 13), angina (n = 15), congestive heart failure (n = 24), peripheral vascular disease (n = 8), transient ischemic attack (n = 13), stroke (n = 23), and pacemaker insertion (n = 1). Fifty of the events were attributed to active lupus, 31 events in 22 patients were attributed to atherosclerosis, and 16 events were attributed to other causes. The mean +/- SD time from diagnosis to the first atherosclerotic event was 2.0 +/- 1.5 years. Compared with patients followed for 2 years without atherosclerotic events (n = 615), at enrollment, patients with atherosclerotic vascular events were more frequently white, men, older at diagnosis of SLE, obese, smokers, hypertensive, and had a family history of coronary artery disease. On multivariate analysis, only male sex and older age at diagnosis were associated factors. CONCLUSION: In an inception cohort with SLE followed for up to 8 years, there were 97 vascular events, but only 31 were attributable to atherosclerosis. Patients with atherosclerotic events were more likely to be men and to be older at diagnosis of SLE.;2010-2012
98;The efficacy of low-dose mycophenolate mofetil for treatment of lupus nephritis in Taiwanese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2010;Clinical rheumatology;Weng MY;Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has recently been introduced as an immunosuppressive  agent for the treatment of glomerulonephritis with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the data have been encouraging. However, response to MMF treatment appears to differ ethnically. Therefore, we determined efficacy and safety of low-dose MMF for Taiwanese patients with lupus nephritis. We studied 36 lupus nephritis patients who were treated with MMF. The dose started at 0.5 g/day and we collected the data from patients who received up to 1 g/day MMF. Outcome measures were 24 h for proteinuria, serum creatinine, C3/C4 levels, and anti-dsDNA titers collected at the baseline and at 3-month treatment intervals. Daily urinary protein significantly decreased from 6.15 +/- 4.28 g to 2.69 +/- 2.36 g at the last visit (P < 0.01) in spite of the significant absence of changes in serum creatinine levels. The response rate was 65.7% including five (14.3%) cases of complete remission and 18 (51.4%) cases of partial remission. The concomitant oral prednisolone dose decreased significantly from 20.07 +/- 11.78 mg/day to 13.93 +/- 6.79 mg/day at 6 months (P < 0.01). The level of C3 increased significantly from 59.46 +/- 32.73 to 71.99 +/- 25.81 (P < 0.01) and the anti-dsDNA antibody titer decreased from 161.71 +/- 221.42 to 46.57 +/- 117.47 (P < 0.01). No severe adverse effects were observed in the study. Low-dose MMF (0.5 to 1 g/day) combined with glucocorticoids appears to be a safe and effective therapy for lupus nephritis in Taiwanese patients. Our results suggest  that lupus nephritis in Oriental patients might respond to lower doses of MMF than Caucasians.;2010-2012
99;STAT4 associates with systemic lupus erythematosus through two independent effects that correlate with gene expression and act additively with IRF5 to increase risk.;2009;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Abelson AK;OBJECTIVES: To confirm and define the genetic association of STAT4 and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), investigate the possibility of correlations with differential splicing and/or expression levels, and genetic interaction with IRF5. METHODS: 30 tag SNPs were genotyped in an independent set of Spanish cases  and controls. SNPs surviving correction for multiple tests were genotyped in five new sets of cases and controls for replication. STAT4 cDNA was analysed by 5'-RACE PCR and sequencing. Expression levels were measured by quantitative PCR.  RESULTS: In the fine mapping, four SNPs were significant after correction for multiple testing, with rs3821236 and rs3024866 as the strongest signals, followed by the previously associated rs7574865, and by rs1467199. Association was replicated in all cohorts. After conditional regression analyses, two major independent signals, represented by SNPs rs3821236 and rs7574865, remained significant across the sets. These SNPs belong to separate haplotype blocks. High levels of STAT4 expression correlated with SNPs rs3821236, rs3024866 (both in the same haplotype block) and rs7574865 but not with other SNPs. Transcription of alternative tissue-specific exons 1, indicating the presence of tissue-specific promoters of potential importance in the expression of STAT4, was also detected.  No interaction with associated SNPs of IRF5 was observed using regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm STAT4 as a susceptibility gene for SLE  and suggest the presence of at least two functional variants affecting levels of  STAT4. The results also indicate that the genes STAT4 and IRF5 act additively to  increase the risk for SLE.;2007-2009
100;Depletion of autoreactive immunologic memory followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with refractory SLE induces long-term remission through de novo generation of a juvenile and tolerant immune system.;2009;Blood;Alexander T;Clinical trials have indicated that immunoablation followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has the potential to induce clinical remission in patients with refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the mechanisms have remained unclear. We now report the results of a single-center prospective study of long-term immune reconstitution after ASCT in  7 patients with SLE. The clinical remissions observed in these patients are accompanied by the depletion of autoreactive immunologic memory, reflected by the disappearance of pathogenic anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies and protective antibodies in serum and a fundamental resetting of the adaptive immune system. The latter comprises recurrence of CD31(+)CD45RA(+)CD4(+) T cells (recent thymic emigrants) with a doubling in absolute numbers compared with age-matched healthy controls at the 3-year follow-up (P = .016), the regeneration of thymic-derived FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells, and normalization of peripheral T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire usage. Likewise, responders exhibited normalization of the previously disturbed B-cell homeostasis with numeric recovery of the naive B-cell compartment within 1 year after ASCT. These data are the first to demonstrate that both depletion of the autoreactive immunologic memory and a profound resetting of the adaptive immune system are required to reestablish self-tolerance in SLE.;2007-2009
101;Adverse events and efficacy of TNF-alpha blockade with infliximab in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: long-term follow-up of 13 patients.;2009;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Aringer M;OBJECTIVE: To follow-up on all available infliximab-treated SLE patients for safety and long-term efficacy in order to extract information that is useful for  planning appropriate controlled trials with infliximab in SLE. METHODS: We analysed charts of six patients treated in an open-label safety trial and seven additional patients treated with infliximab on a compassionate care basis for uncontrolled SLE organ inflammation. RESULTS: Out of nine patients with lupus nephritis, six had a long-term response after four infusions of infliximab in combination with AZA, lasting for up to 5 years. All five patients with lupus arthritis responded, but this response did not last for >2 months after the last  infusion. One additional patient had a long-lasting improvement in SLE interstitial lung disease. No symptoms suggestive of infliximab-induced SLE flares occurred in any patients. Short-term treatment appeared relatively safe, but one patient developed deep-vein thrombosis and several infections. Under long-term therapy, two patients had life-threatening or fatal events, namely CNS  lymphoma and Legionella pneumonia. Retreatment and treatment without concomitant  immunosuppression led to drug reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term therapy with four infusions of infliximab in combination with AZA was relatively safe, and had remarkable long-term efficacy for lupus nephritis and, potentially, also interstitial lung disease. Long-term therapy with infliximab, however, was associated with severe adverse events in two out of three SLE patients, which may have been provoked by infliximab and/or by their long-standing refractory SLE and previous therapies.;2007-2009
102;Use of pharmacogenetics, enzymatic phenotyping, and metabolite monitoring to guide treatment with azathioprine in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2009;The Journal of rheumatology;Askanase AD;OBJECTIVE: Individualized therapy based on genetic background and monitoring of metabolites can optimize drug safety and efficacy. Such an approach is available  for azathioprine (AZA), the thiopurine antimetabolite. AZA exerts therapeutic effects when metabolized to the active thiopurine nucleotide, 6-thioguanine (6-TGN). In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 6-TGN levels in the target range of 235-400 pmol/8x10(8) red blood cells (RBC) are associated with a high likelihood  of response. Our objective was to evaluate whether drug escalation based on metabolite levels improves efficacy and maintains safety in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: We conducted a 6-month open-label dose-escalation clinical study of patients with active SLE treated with azathioprine dosed by body weight and metabolite levels. The primary endpoint was >or=50% improvement in any one parameter of disease activity, or 50% decrease in  glucocorticoid dose. RESULTS: Of 50 patients enrolled in the study, 21 achieved clinical responses, 13 of whom had 6-TGN<235 pmol/8 x10(8) RBC. Ten patients had  no clinical response at 6 months, yet achieved either therapeutic IBD 6-TGN levels (>235, n=4) or received maximum AZA dose>or=3.5 mg/kg (n=6). In 19 patients the drug was discontinued prematurely due to side effects or SLE activity. For those patients in whom either liver function test or white blood cell count abnormalities were encountered, metabolites guided attribution to drug or disease activity. CONCLUSION: Clinical responses in SLE can occur at levels of 6-TGN lower than the target range established for IBD. During followup, measurements of AZA metabolites may provide a rational approach to safety.;2007-2009
103;Corticosteroid use in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus-practice patterns at four pediatric rheumatology centers.;2009;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Brunner HI;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate corticosteroid prescribing patterns in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), comparing four academic pediatric rheumatology practices. METHODS: Patients with childhood-onset SLE (n=72) treated at four large pediatric rheumatology centers were studied at 3-month intervals for 18 months. Information on medication use, disease activity as measured by the SLEDAI and the SLAM; and disease damage by the SLICC/ACR Damage Index was collected. RESULTS: At the time of enrollment, patients at each center were similar for disease duration, age, frequency of renal involvement and disease damage. Prednisone (mean 9 mg/day) was continued during 72% of periods of inactive disease for at least 3 months (SLEDAI=0). Centers differed in the use of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone (p<0.0001). Even when adjusted for between-center differences in patient weight, race and disease activity, centers  also significantly differed in the dose of prednisone (p<0.05). The center with the largest between-patient variability in the dose of prednisone prescribed to its patients showed the smallest between-patient variance in patient disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids are commonly used for the treatment of childhood-onset SLE, even when the disease is inactive. There appears to be important between-center differences in the use of intravenous and oral corticosteroids for childhood-onset SLE therapy that cannot be explained by patient disease activity corticosteroid prescribing patterns influence disease control. Further studies are needed to determine whether differences in practice  patterns lead to significant differences in longer-term disease outcomes with childhood-onset SLE.";2007-2009
104;Traditional and non traditional risk factors in accelerated atherosclerosis in systemic lupus erythematosus: role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGATS  Study).;2009;Autoimmunity reviews;Colombo BM;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in accelerated atherosclerosis in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).  METHODS: We have enrolled 80 SLE female patients and 80 age-matched healthy control females who underwent a structured interview, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, VEGF plasma level determination and B-mode ultrasonography of carotid arteries to determine carotid intima media thickness (IMT). Framingham risk factors for cardiovascular events were also calculated and VEGF plasma levels were correlated with traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: SLE was significantly associated with higher mean IMT values (0.74+/-0.15 mm versus 0.59+/-0.12 mm in controls, p<0.001) and higher mean plasma VEGF levels (307.9+/-292.2 pg/mL versus 120.7+/-118.4 pg/mL in controls, p<0.001) independently from age, smoking habits, and Framingham risk factors. A significant correlation was also found between IMT and VEGF values (r=0.25; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: We show that SLE patients have increased mean IMT and VEGF values as compared with healthy age-matched controls  and that IMT and VEGF values are independently and directly associated with SLE disease.";2007-2009
105;Flow cytometry analysis of glucocorticoid receptor expression and binding in steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2009;Arthritis research & therapy;Du J;INTRODUCTION: Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy is the main treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, some patients are resistant to these agents.  Abnormalities of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) seem to be related to steroid resistance. This study evaluated GRs in T lymphocytes and monocytes of SLE patients by flow cytometry (FCM) using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) and FITC-Dex probes. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with SLE before treatment and 27 age- and sex-matched normal controls were studied. Disease activity scores were determined before and after treatment and used to divide the patients into steroid-resistant (SR) and steroid-sensitive (SS) groups. GRs in T lymphocytes (CD3+) and monocytes (CD14+) were examined by FCM with GR-mAb and FITC-Dex probes before treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated for in vitro GCs sensitivity assays. The validity of FCM analysis of intracellular staining for GR with GR-mAb and FITC-Dex probes was evaluated through comparison with western blot and radioligand binding assay (RLBA) in U937 and K562 cells in vitro. One-way ANOVA, student's t test, linear regression and spearman correlation were  performed. RESULTS: A significant decrease in GR binding and the expression in K562 and U937 cells with 10-6 M dexamethasone (Dex) was found compared with those without Dex. In addition, a positive correlation was found between FCM and RLBA as well as FCM and Western blot. The expression and binding of both CD3/GR and CD14/GR in SR patients with SLE, detected by FCM, were all lower than those in SS patients with SLE, whereas there was no significant difference in SS patients and controls. In vitro corticosteroid sensitivity assay indicated that PHA-stimulated tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-12 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)  secretion was significantly inhibited by 10-6 M Dexamethasone in all controls and SS patients, compared with that in SR group, which confirms patient classification as SR and SS by disease activity index (SLEDAI) score. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of expression and binding of the GR may be involved in tissue resistance to steroids in SLE patients. Determination of GR expression and binding by FCM may be useful in predicting the response to steroid treatment of SLE patients.;2007-2009
106;Mycophenolate mofetil for the treatment of juvenile onset SLE: a multicenter study.;2009;Lupus;Falcini F;"Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has proved to be an efficacious and safe therapy in adult lupus nephritis. Recently, this drug has been suggested as a possible new alternative treatment also for juvenile-onset SLE (juvenile-SLE). A multicenter study has been performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MMF in controlling the disease activity in children and adolescents with juvenile-SLE. Our results show that MMF was effective in reducing the disease activity or as a  steroid-sparing agent in 14 of 26 patients (54%), stabilised the disease in 8 (31%) and was ineffective in 4 (15%). In particular, in patients without renal involvement, a good response was registered in 9 of 13 patients (69%). Among those patients with renal involvement, MMF was effective in 5 of 13 patients (38%), partially effective in 4 (31%) and ineffective in 4 (31%). No severe side  effects have been observed; only two patients stopped the drug because of severe  diarrhoea and abdominal pain. With the limits of a retrospective study, MMF seems to be effective and safe for the treatment of juvenile-SLE, especially in patients with no renal involvement.";2007-2009
107;Random spot urine protein/creatinine ratio is unreliable for estimating 24-hour proteinuria in individual systemic lupus erythematosus nephritis patients.;2009;Nephron. Clinical practice;Hebert LA;BACKGROUND: Recently the American Rheumatologic Association (ARA) recommended random spot urine protein/creatinine ratio (P/C) to monitor systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) glomerulonephritis (GN). Shortly afterward, 2 works were published, designated Study 1 and Study 2, which are the only studies to test spot P/C in SLE GN. Here we evaluate Study 1 and Study 2, which came to different conclusions. METHODS: Study 1 compared spot P/C to the P/C of intended 24-hour collections >50% complete, which reliably estimates 24-hour proteinuria. Study 2  compared spot P/C to the protein content of intended 24-hour collections >80% complete. To compare studies, Study 2 data were converted to P/C ratios. RESULTS: Study 1 and Study 2 were found to be in agreement. Both showed that spot P/C and  24-hour P/C were highly correlated, but only when compared over the entire P/C range (0-8.0) (r = 0.842). Over the P/C range 0.5-3.0 (the most common P/C range  encountered in SLE GN), correlation was present, but concordance was poor, rendering random P/C ratio unreliable. CONCLUSIONS: Random spot P/C ratio is unreliable for detecting moderate proteinuria change. For example, random spot P/C would not reliably diagnose British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) Category A or B proteinuric flares.;2007-2009

ANA were determined by line immunoassay and by indirect immunofluorescence on Crithidia luciliae. RESULTS: Renal involvement, encephalopathy and haemolytic anaemia were seen, and anti-dsDNA, anti-ribosomal P and antihistone antibodies found, significantly more often in juvenile-onset SLE. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were directly associated, and anti-ribosomal P antibodies inversely associated, with renal involvement in juvenile-onset SLE. In juvenile patients with SLE and anti-dsDNA and without anti-ribosomal P antibodies the odds ratio for glomerulonephritis was 9.00; no patients with anti-ribosomal P but without anti-dsDNA had renal involvement. CONCLUSION: Patients with juvenile-onset SLE more often have renal involvement and encephalopathy than patients with adult-onset SLE. Anti-ribosomal P, anti-dsDNA and antihistone antibodies are more often found in patients with juvenile-onset SLE.";2007-2009
109;Combination of TNF-RII, CYP1A1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms and the risk of Japanese SLE: findings from the KYSS study.;2009;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Horiuchi T;"OBJECTIVES: Association of the polymorphisms of the genes, TNF receptor type II gene (TNF-RII), cytochrome P4501A1 gene (CYP1A1) and glutathione S-transferase M1 gene (GSTM1), with SLE was investigated. TNF-RII mediates inflammatory and immune response, whereas CYP1A1 and GSTM1 are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics. These three genes are involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which play a critical role for autoimmune diseases. METHODS: A total of 152 SLE patients and 427 healthy individuals in a female Japanese population were enrolled in the study. Case-control studies were performed for the polymorphisms  of these three genes. RESULTS: The carriers of TNF-RII 196R were at a significantly increased risk for SLE with odds ratio (OR) of 1.59 (95% CI = 1.01, 2.52). CYP1A1 3801C homozygotes had a significantly increased risk of SLE (OR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.28, 4.78). On the other hand, GSTM1 null genotype was not associated with SLE risk. As for combination action of two loci, CYP1A1 3801C/GSTM1 null combination was more strongly associated with an increased risk  of SLE (OR = 4.35; 95% CI = 1.76, 10.73). Moreover, TNF-RII 196M/CYP1A1 3801C/GSTM1 null genotype combination was most significantly associated with SLE  (OR = 5.83; 95% CI = 2, 17.04). CONCLUSIONS: The individuals carrying two or more 'at-risk' genotypes of TNF-RII, CYP1A1 and GSTM1 had a significantly more increased risk for SLE compared with those having each 'at-risk' genotype. Combination of the risk genotypes will be important to more clearly identify the  population at risk for SLE.";2007-2009
110;Risk and protective factors for thrombosis in systemic lupus erythematosus: results from a large, multi-ethnic cohort.;2009;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Kaiser R;OBJECTIVES: Few studies have examined thrombosis in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), none have included Asian-Americans, and most have had small sample sizes.  We analysed risk factors for thrombosis in a large, multi-ethnic SLE cohort. METHODS: We studied 1930 SLE subjects, including Caucasians, African-Americans, Asian-Americans and Hispanics. Data were derived from questionnaires and medical  records. Documented history of thrombosis was the primary outcome. Explanatory variables included age at SLE diagnosis, gender, ethnicity, disease duration, smoking, antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) status, nephritis and specific medications. RESULTS: Smoking (OR 1.26, p = 0.011), longer disease duration (OR 1.26 per 5 years p = 0.027 x 10(-7)), nephritis (OR 1.35, p = 0.036), aPL positivity (OR 3.22, p<10(-9)) and immunomodulating medication use (OR 1.40, p =  0.011) were statistically significant risk factors for thrombosis. Younger age at SLE onset was protective (OR 0.52 for age </=20, p = 0.001). After adjusting for  disease severity and incorporating propensity scores, hydroxychloroquine use remained significantly protective for thrombosis (OR 0.62, p = 4.91 x 10(-4)). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that older age at onset, longer disease duration, smoking, aPL positivity, history of nephritis and immunomodulating medication use are risk factors for thrombosis in SLE. These data are the first to confirm in a large and ethnically diverse SLE cohort that hydroxychloroquine use is protective for thrombosis.;2007-2009
111;Myeloid leukaemia in systemic lupus erythematosus--a nested case-control study based on Swedish registers.;2009;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Lofstrom B;OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk factors for leukaemic transformation and myeloid leukaemia in patients with SLE. METHODS: A national SLE cohort identified through SLE discharge diagnoses in the Swedish hospital discharge register during 1964 to 1995 (n = 6438) was linked to the national cancer register. A nested case-control study in SLE patients who developed acute or chronic myeloid leukaemia was performed with SLE patients without malignancy as controls. Medical records from  cases and controls were reviewed and bone marrow specimens were re-evaluated. A Medline search of previously published cases of SLE and myeloid leukaemia was performed. RESULTS: After confirmation of SLE diagnosis according to the ACR criteria, eight patients with SLE and myeloid leukaemia and 18 SLE controls were  included in the study. Preceding leucopenia was significantly associated with leukaemia development, whereas other SLE manifestations were not. Two cases had a preceding bone marrow confirming myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Only two cases were significantly treated with cyclophosphamide or AZA. A Medline search resulted in only 15 previously published cases of coincident SLE and myeloid leukaemia. Preceding MDS was reported in five of these, whereas only eight had been treated with cytotoxic drugs. CONCLUSION: Low-dose chemotherapy was not a major cause of myeloid malignancy in our population-based cohort of SLE patients  nor in the reported cases from literature. Leucopenia was a risk factor for myeloid leukaemia development and an MDS was frequently seen. Therefore bone marrow investigation should be considered in SLE patients with long-standing leucopenia and anaemia.;2007-2009
112;Effect of fluvastatin on cardiac outcomes in kidney transplant patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomized placebo-controlled study.;2009;Arthritis and rheumatism;Norby GE;OBJECTIVE: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with or without end-stage renal failure, are at increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease. Although statin therapy has been found to reduce cardiovascular risk in  the general population, its effectiveness in kidney transplant recipients with SLE has not been examined. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of fluvastatin on cardiac end points in a randomized controlled trial of renal transplant patients with SLE. METHODS: Patients with SLE were identified from among participants in the Assessment of Lescol in Renal Transplantation trial, a  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effect of fluvastatin (40-80 mg/day) on cardiovascular outcomes in renal transplant recipients. Patients were randomized to either a group receiving fluvastatin or a placebo group for the duration of the 5-6-year trial, and then invited to continue in a 2-year open-label extension during which all participants, regardless of original group, received fluvastatin. Patients were followed up for a total of 7-8 years for assessment of the primary end point of major cardiac events, comprising nonfatal myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and coronary intervention procedures. RESULTS: Fluvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 29.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 18.3-40%), from a mean +/- SD of 4.0 +/- 0.9 mmoles/liter to 2.8 +/- 1.1 mmoles/liter, and total cholesterol by 19.6% (95% CI 11.7-27.5%), from 6.4 +/- 0.9 mmoles/liter to 5.1 +/- 1.1 mmoles/liter. Compared with placebo-treated patients, patients randomized to receive fluvastatin exhibited a 73.4% reduction in the risk of major cardiac events (relative risk 26.6 [95% CI 5.9-119.4], P = 0.064). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the effect of fluvastatin on cardiac events in renal transplant recipients with SLE is similar to that observed with statin therapy in the renal transplant population as a whole.;2007-2009
113;Macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus: a multinational multicenter study of thirty-eight patients.;2009;Arthritis and rheumatism;Parodi A;OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and laboratory features of macrophage activation syndrome as a complication of juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Cases of juvenile SLE-associated macrophage activation syndrome were provided by investigators belonging to 3 pediatric rheumatology networks or  were found in the literature. Patients who had evidence of macrophage hemophagocytosis on bone marrow aspiration were considered to have definite macrophage activation syndrome, and those who did not have such evidence were considered to have probable macrophage activation syndrome. Clinical and laboratory findings in patients with macrophage activation syndrome were contrasted with those of 2 control groups composed of patients with active juvenile SLE without macrophage activation syndrome. The ability of each feature  to discriminate macrophage activation syndrome from active disease was evaluated  by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: The study included 38 patients (20 with definite macrophage activation syndrome and 18 with probable macrophage activation syndrome). Patients with definite and probable macrophage activation syndrome were comparable with regard to all clinical and laboratory features of the syndrome, except for a greater frequency of lymphadenopathy, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia in patients with definite macrophage activation syndrome. Overall, clinical features had better specificity than sensitivity, except for fever, which was highly sensitive but had low specificity. Among laboratory features, the best sensitivity and specificity was achieved using hyperferritinemia, followed by increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypofibrinogenemia. Based on the results of statistical analysis, preliminary diagnostic guidelines for macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile SLE were developed. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the occurrence of unexplained fever and cytopenia, when associated with hyperferritinemia, in a patient with juvenile SLE should raise the suspicion of macrophage activation syndrome. We propose preliminary guidelines for this syndrome in juvenile SLE to facilitate timely diagnosis and correct classification of patients.;2007-2009
114;An exploratory dose-escalating study investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous atacicept in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2009;Lupus;Pena-Rossi C;"Atacicept, a recombinant fusion protein containing the extracellular, ligand-binding portion of the transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin-ligand interactor receptor, and the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin (Ig) G, is designed to block the activity of B-lymphocyte stimulator and a proliferation-inducing ligand, and may have utility as a treatment for B-cell-mediated diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This Phase Ib study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of intravenous (i.v.) atacicept in patients with mild-to-moderate SLE. Patients (n = 24) were randomised (5:1) to receive atacicept (single dose: 3, 9 or 18 mg/kg; or multiple dose: 2 x 9 mg/kg)  or matching placebo. Patients were followed for 6 weeks after dosing (9 weeks in  the 2 x 9 mg/kg cohort). Local tolerability of atacicept was comparable with that of placebo, with only mild injection-site reactions reported with atacicept. Atacicept i.v. was generally well tolerated, both systemically and locally, in patients with mild-to-moderate SLE. Atacicept displayed non-linear PK, which was  predictable across doses and between single and repeat doses. The biological activity of atacicept was demonstrated by its marked effect in reducing B-cells and Ig levels in patients with SLE. This supports the utility of this therapeutic approach in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as SLE.";2007-2009
115;Factors predictive of overall health over the course of the disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus from the LUMINA cohort (LXII): use of the SF-6D.;2009;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Sanchez ML;"OBJECTIVE: Health related quality of life (HRQOL) over course of the disease was  ascertained in SLE patients from LUMINA, a multiethnic US cohort, using the SF-36-derived utility measure, the SF-6D. METHODS: All available visits were examined to predict HRQOL using either variables from the baseline or enrollment  visits or from the preceding visits. The physical and mental component summary (PCS and MCS, respectively) measures of the SF-36 were also examined. A total of  2662 visits from 588 SLE patients were included; 90% of the patients were women,  19% Hispanic-Texans, 17% Hispanic-Puerto Ricans, 35% African Americans and 29% Caucasians. The patients' mean (SD) SF-6D was 0.6 (0.1). RESULTS: In multivariable analyses, Hispanic-Texan ethnicity and higher levels of social support were predictors of HRQOL whereas older age, poverty, greater disease activity and damage and higher levels of fatigue, helplessness and abnormal illness-related behaviors were negative predictors. Prior SF-6D was the strongest variable predictive of subsequent HRQOL, when included. The analyses in which the PCS and MCS were examined as end-points were, overall, consistent with the SF-6D  results. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the SF-6D index provides an adequate measure of self-perceived HRQOL and that patients' self-perception of HRQOL is influenced by disease and non-disease related factors.";2007-2009

117;Clonal expansion of B-cells in human systemic lupus erythematosus: evidence from  studies before and after therapeutic B-cell depletion.;2009;Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.);Sfikakis PP;Anti-B-cell therapy may be beneficial for patients with SLE and active proliferative glomerulonephritis. Using genomic DNA, we examined how rituximab-induced transient B-cell depletion affected the composition of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (Ig-VH/DH/JH) repertoire at the time-point of 33-35% B-cell reconstitution in these patients. Clusters of clonaly-related Ig-VH/DH/JH  sequences were evident in all 7 patients with active SLE but in none of 4 healthy subjects studied for comparison. In addition to original somatic mutation(s) shared in the majority of clonaly-related sequences, ongoing mutation suggested expansion of single B-cell precursors and clonal evolution. Otherwise, lupus repertoire was similar to that of healthy subjects with the exception of increased somatic hypermutation. The regenerating repertoire was diverse and comparable to baseline, albeit with fewer somatic mutations but more clonal expansions. Since clonal expansion may lead to preferential survival/growth of potentially autoreactive B-cells further studies are warranted, especially as therapies aiming to reduce B-cell survival emerge.;2007-2009
118;Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation reverses multiorgan dysfunction in systemic lupus erythematosus mice and humans.;2009;Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio);Sun L;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease that, despite the advances in immunosuppressive medical therapies, remains potentially  fatal in some patients, especially in treatment-refractory patients. Here, we reported that impairment of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and their associated osteoblastic niche deficiency contribute in part to the pathogenesis of SLE-like disease in MRL/lpr mice. Interestingly, allogenic BMMSC transplantation (MSCT) is capable of reconstructing the bone marrow osteoblastic  niche and more effectively reverses multiorgan dysfunction when compared with medical immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide (CTX). At the cellular level, MSCT, not CTX treatment, was capable to induce osteoblastic niche reconstruction, possibly contributing to the recovery of regulatory T-cells and reestablishment of the immune homeostasis. On the basis of the promising clinical outcomes in SLE mice, we treated four CTX/glucocorticoid treatment-refractory SLE patients using  allogenic MSCT and showed a stable 12-18 months disease remission in all treated  patients. The patients benefited an amelioration of disease activity, improvement in serologic markers and renal function. These early evidences suggest that allogenic MSCT may be a feasible and safe salvage therapy in refractory SLE patients.;2007-2009
119;Health-related quality of life and its relationship to patient disease course in  childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus.;2009;The Journal of rheumatology;Brunner HI;"OBJECTIVE: To (1) estimate the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of children with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) and compare it to that of normative cohorts; (2) assess the relationship of HRQOL with cSLE disease activity and damage; and (3) determine the effects of changes of disease activity on HRQOL. METHODS: Patients with cSLE (n = 98) followed every 3 months completed  HRQOL measures, the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Generic Core scale (PedsQL-GC), the Rheumatology Module (PedsQL-RM), and the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). The British Isles Lupus Activity Group Index (BILAG) was used to measure organ-system-specific disease activity. Physicians rated the course of cSLE between visits. RESULTS: At baseline, mean (standard deviation, SD) score [parent report] of the PedsQL-GC and the PedsQL-RM was 75 (17) and 79 (14), respectively; the mean (SD) of the CHQ physical summary score (CHQ-PHS) was 49 (7) and that of the CHQ psychological summary score was 42 (12). Higher BILAG  scores, especially in the general, musculoskeletal, neurological, and vascular, but not the mucocutaneous, renal, cardiovascular, or hematological BILAG domains, were associated with a significantly lower HRQOL. Patients with damage had lower  HRQOL than those without damage. All HRQOL measures included were at most modestly responsive to clinically important changes with cSLE. CONCLUSION: HRQOL  with cSLE is significantly lower than that reported in healthy populations. Organ-specific involvement with cSLE has a differential effect on HRQOL. Higher disease activity and damage are associated with significantly lower HRQOL as measured by the PedsQL-RM and the CHQ-PHS, and worsening of cSLE leads to a further decline. ";2007-2009
120;Efficacy and safety of infliximab in active SLE: a pilot study.;2009;Lupus;Uppal SS;Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a major role in propagating the inflammatory processes responsible for tissue damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is overexpressed both systemically and locally in this disease. Hence, this pilot study was carried out to assess the safety and efficacy of TNF blockade in patients with active SLE. A total of 46 individuals (27 patients with active SLE and 19 healthy control volunteers) were the subjects of this study. Nine patients with SLE were allocated to treatment arm and 18 were allocated to control arm. In addition to conventional treatment, treatment arm received infliximab infusions 3 mg/kg body weight at 0, 2, 6 weeks and then q 8 weeks for a total of 24 weeks, that is, a total of five doses. Patients were closely monitored for infection. Clinical, laboratory and treatment data were entered into a pre-designed proforma. Health status (SF-36), patient global assessment (PGA) of disease activity, disease activity scores by SLEDAI and organ damage by SLICC/ACR-DI (American College Rheumatology) were measured at baseline  and end of the study. Relevant immunological studies included serum levels of TNF-alpha and soluble TNF receptors-1 (p55 srTNF-alpha) and -2 (p75 srTNF-alpha), C3 and C4 complement levels, anti-dsDNA antibody titres (IgM, IgG and IgA isotypes), anti-cardiolipin titres (IgM, IgG and IgA isotypes) and anti-beta2GPI  (Glycoprotein I) antibody titres (IgM, IgG and IgA isotypes). Four patients from  treatment arm dropped out due to infliximab infusion reaction and 12 patients dropped out from the control arm. The treatment group showed significantly greater improvement in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). Improvements in several SF-36 subscales, PGA and VAS-Fatigue (Visual Analogue Scale) were also greater in the treatment group but did not achieve statistical significance. The mean levels of TNF-alpha, soluble TNF receptors-1 (p55 srTNF-alpha) and -2 (p75 srTNF-alpha) were higher in the SLE group compared  with the healthy controls but did not change significantly over the study period. We did not face any safety issues with infliximab in this study. In view of improvement in several SLE parameters and good safety profile of infliximab, anti-TNF-alpha therapy is an interesting candidate approach for treating SLE.;2007-2009
121;Impact of immigration on the clinical expression of systemic lupus erythematosus: a comparative study of Hispanic patients residing in the USA and Mexico.;2009;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Uribe AG;OBJECTIVE: To compare the socio-economic characteristics, clinical features and health-related quality of life in Hispanic SLE patients residing in Mexico and in the Southwest USA (Mexican and Texan, herein). METHODS: Mexican and Texan SLE patients (fulfilling ACR criteria) participating in separate longitudinal outcome studies were evaluated. Texan patients were randomly chosen to match total disease duration with the Mexican patients. Cross-sectional data for the Mexican  patients were obtained by a US-trained investigator who had previously participated in data collection for the cohort to which the Texan patients belonged. Socio-economic and -demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, disease activity (with SLAM-Revised), damage accrual (with SLICC/ACR Damage Index) and self-reported function (with Short Form-36) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Seventy Mexican patients were matched with either one or two Texan patients (n = 94) for a total of 164 patients. Mexican patients were younger. In age-adjusted analyses, the Mexican patients were more educated, had better health-related quality of life and overall less systemic SLE manifestations. Mexican patients were exposed more frequently to AZA. CONCLUSIONS: Texan patients had more severe disease than the Mexican patients. In multivariable analyses, Texan Hispanic ethnicity was significantly associated with high disease activity, but significance was not reached for damage. The discrepant findings observed between these two Hispanic groups of SLE patients may reflect socio-economic or biological factors. Given the global phenomenon of immigration, rheumatologists should be aware of the overall course  and outcome of immigrant SLE patients if undesirable outcomes are to be prevented.;2007-2009

METHODS: Thirty patients with inactive or controlled SLE were included in the study. Patients were randomized to receive a 12-month course of either tibolona (2.5 mg/day) or placebo. The following were investigated: hypoestrogenism symptoms by  Kupperman index, weight; anti-dsDNA antibodies; SLE flares (frequency) assessed by the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI); and biochemical profile (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], triglycerides, complement components [C3/C4], alpha1-acid glycoprotein,  urea, creatinine, 24-h proteinuria, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate). RESULTS: The reduction in Kupperman index was greater in the patients using tibolone than in those using placebo. The mean SLEDAI was not different between the groups during the study as well as SLE flare frequency (tibolone: 2/15 [13.3%] vs. placebo: 1/15 [6.7%]; p=0.54). All cases of flares were considered mild to moderate. Although the groups were similar at the baseline evaluation, after 6 and 12 months of treatment lower values were found in the tibolone group for triglycerides (6 months: 161.6+/-30.9 mg/dl vs. 194.4+/-46.5; p=0.04; 12 months 163.7+/-29.8 mg/dl vs. 204.1+/-49.9 mg/dl; p=0.02; tibolone vs. placebo group, respectively) and for HDL-C (6 months: 40.7+/-10.7 mg/dl vs. 53.4+/-16.5; p=0.02; 12 months: 47.2+/-7.9 mg/dl vs. 63.2+/-16.3mg/dl; p<0.01; tibolone vs. placebo group, respectively). There were no differences between the two groups in any of the remaining variables. CONCLUSION: In patients with inactive or stable SLE, the short-term use of tibolone did not significantly affect the frequency of flares. In addition, tibolone was well tolerated and effective to control hypoestrogenism related symptoms in SLE patients.";2007-2009

METHODS: Patients with a Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus: National Assessment (SELENA) version of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score >/=4 (n = 449) were randomly assigned to belimumab (1, 4, or 10 mg/kg) or placebo in a 52-week study. Coprimary end points were the percent change in the SELENA-SLEDAI score at week 24 and the time to first SLE flare. RESULTS: Significant differences between the treatment and placebo groups were not attained for either primary end point,  and no dose response was observed. Reductions in SELENA-SLEDAI scores from baseline were 19.5% in the combined belimumab group versus 17.2% in the placebo group. The median time to first SLE flare was 67 days in the combined belimumab group versus 83 days in the placebo group. However, the median time to first SLE  flare during weeks 24-52 was significantly longer with belimumab treatment (154 versus 108 days; P = 0.0361). In the subgroup (71.5%) of serologically active patients (antinuclear antibody titer >/=1:80 and/or anti-double-stranded DNA [anti-dsDNA] >/=30 IU/ml), belimumab treatment resulted in significantly better responses at week 52 than placebo for SELENA-SLEDAI score (-28.8% versus -14.2%;  P = 0.0435), physician's global assessment (-32.7% versus -10.7%; P = 0.0011), and Short Form 36 physical component score (+3.0 versus +1.2 points; P = 0.0410). Treatment with belimumab resulted in a 63-71% reduction of naive, activated, and  plasmacytoid CD20+ B cells, and a 29.4% reduction in anti-dsDNA titers (P = 0.0017) by week 52. The rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the belimumab and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: Belimumab was biologically active and well tolerated. The effect of belimumab on the reduction  of SLE disease activity or flares was not significant. However, serologically active SLE patients responded significantly better to belimumab therapy plus SOC  than to SOC alone.

124;A polymorphism within IL21R confers risk for systemic lupus erythematosus.;2009;Arthritis and rheumatism;Webb R;OBJECTIVE: Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a member of the type I cytokine superfamily  that has a variety of effects on the immune system, including B cell activation,  plasma cell differentiation, and immunoglobulin production. The expression of IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) is reduced in the B cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), while serum IL-21 levels are increased both in lupus patients and in some murine lupus models. We recently reported that polymorphisms within the IL21 gene are associated with increased susceptibility to SLE. The aim of this study was to examine the genetic association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within IL21R and SLE. METHODS: We genotyped 17 SNPs in the IL21R gene in 2 large cohorts of lupus patients (a European-derived cohort and a  Hispanic cohort) and in ethnically matched healthy controls. RESULTS: We identified and confirmed the association between rs3093301 within the IL21R gene  and SLE in the 2 cohorts (meta-analysis odds ratio 1.16 [95% confidence interval  1.08-1.25], P=1.0x10(-4)). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that IL21R is a novel susceptibility gene for SLE.;2007-2009
125;Neutralization of interferon-alpha/beta-inducible genes and downstream effect in  a phase I trial of an anti-interferon-alpha monoclonal antibody in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2009;Arthritis and rheumatism;Yao Y;OBJECTIVE: Type I interferons (IFNs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This phase Ia trial was undertaken to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of anti-IFNalpha monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy in SLE. During the trial, we also examined whether overexpression of an IFNalpha/beta-inducible gene signature in whole blood could serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker to evaluate IFNalpha neutralization and investigated downstream effects of neutralizing IFNalpha on BAFF and other key signaling pathways, i.e., granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and IL-1beta, in SLE. METHODS: Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays were used to profile whole blood and lesional skin of patients receiving standard therapy for mild to moderate SLE. Selected IFNalpha/beta-inducible proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:  With the study treatment, we observed anti-IFNalpha mAb-specific and dose-dependent inhibition of overexpression of IFNalpha/beta-inducible genes in whole blood and skin lesions from SLE patients, at both the transcript and the protein levels. In SLE patients with overexpression of messenger RNA for BAFF, TNFalpha, IL-10, IL-1beta, GM-CSF, and their respective inducible gene signatures in whole blood and/or skin lesions, we observed a general trend toward suppression of the expression of these genes and/or gene signatures upon treatment with anti-IFNalpha mAb. CONCLUSION: IFNalpha/beta-inducible gene signatures in whole blood are effective pharmacodynamic biomarkers to evaluate anti-IFNalpha mAb therapy in SLE. Anti-IFNalpha mAb can neutralize overexpression of IFNalpha/beta-inducible genes in whole blood and lesional skin from SLE patients and has profound effects on signaling pathways that may be downstream of IFNalpha in SLE.;2007-2009
126;Influences on bone mineral density in Malaysian premenopausal systemic lupus erythematosus patients on corticosteroids.;2009;Lupus;Yeap SS;The aim of this study was to assess the bone mineral density (BMD) of premenopausal patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on corticosteroids (CS) and to determine the influence of CS and other risk factors on BMD. A total  of 98 premenopausal patients with SLE were recruited from outpatient clinics in two teaching hospitals. Risk factors for osteoporosis were determined, and BMD was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The mean age of the patients was 30.05 +/- 7.54 years. The mean dose of prednisolone at time of BMD measurement was 18.38 +/- 10.85 mg daily. Median duration of CS use was 2.5 years (range 0-20). Median cumulative dose of CS was 9.04 g (range 0.28-890.0). Six patients (6.1%) had osteoporosis, 41 (41.9%) had osteopenia and 51 (52.0%) had normal BMD. Lumbar spine T score correlated with cumulative CS dose (P = 0.019).  Duration of CS intake correlated with femoral neck T score (P = 0.04) and trochanter T score (P = 0.008). There was no correlation between BMD and race, SLE Disease Activity Index score, smoking and self-reported calcium intake or exercise. Only 52% of these patients had normal BMD. The duration and cumulative  dose of CS intake was significantly correlated to BMD, but not the other commonly assessed risk factors. These findings suggest that premenopausal patients with SLE on CS should have their BMD measured at regular intervals to fully assess their osteoporosis risk.;2007-2009
127;Relationship between health-related quality of life and SLE activity and damage in children over time.;2009;Lupus;Moorthy LN;We previously described the development and validation of the 'Simple Measure of  the Impact of Lupus Erythematosus in Youngsters' (SMILEY) for the reliable assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The objectives of this new study were to determine the relationship of SMILEY scores to patient's/parent's assessment of HRQOL and SLE status, and physician's assessment of disease activity and damage over time. In this multicentre study, 68 children with SLE and parents completed SMILEY including the global HRQOL and SLE status assessments, physicians completed disease activity and damage tools at two time-points. Spearman rho was calculated between SMILEY scores and other scales, and between interval changes in SMILEY scores and other scales. SMILEY scores correlated with patient/parent assessments of global HRQOL and SLE status, disease activity and damage, confirming previous  findings. The change in disease activity and damage measures correlated most strongly with the changes in SMILEY domains, Limitation and Burden of SLE. Results provide preliminary evidence that Limitation and Burden of SLE domains of SMILEY reflect the impact of disease activity and damage on HRQOL. ;2007-2009
128;The BILAG-2004 index is sensitive to change for assessment of SLE disease activity.;2009;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Yee CS;OBJECTIVE: To determine if the BILAG-2004 index is sensitive to change for assessment of SLE disease activity. METHODS: This was a prospective multi-centre  longitudinal study of SLE patients. At every assessment, data were collected on disease activity (BILAG-2004 index) and treatment. Analyses were performed using  overall BILAG-2004 index score (as determined by the highest score achieved by any of the individual systems) and all the systems scores. Sensitivity to change  was assessed by determining the relationship between change in disease activity and change in therapy between two consecutive visits. Statistical analyses were performed using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 1761 assessments from 347 SLE patients that contributed 1414 observations for analysis. An increase in therapy between visits occurred in 22.7% observations, while 37.3% had a decrease in therapy and in 40.0% therapy was unchanged. Increase in overall BILAG-2004 index score was associated with increase in therapy and inversely associated with decrease in therapy. Decrease in overall BILAG-2004 index score was associated with decrease in therapy and was inversely  associated with increase in therapy. Changes in overall BILAG-2004 index score were differentially related to change in therapy, with greater change in score having greater predictive power. Increase in the scores of most systems was independently associated with an increase in treatment and there was no significant association between decreases in the score of any system with an increase in therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The BILAG-2004 index is sensitive to change and is suitable for use in longitudinal studies of SLE.;2007-2009
129;Effect of afobazole on DNA damage in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2009;Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine;Zhanataev AK;Using comet assay we studied the effect of anxiolytic afobazole, exhibiting also  antioxidant and antimutagenic properties, on spontaneous and ex-vivo hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage in blood cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Afobazole treatment (30-60 mg/day for 1 month) in addition to standard therapy decreased spontaneous level of DNA damage in blood cells. The level of ex vivo hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage decreased by 49% in this group of patients. The number of cells hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide yielding DNA comets with highly damaged DNA also decreased by 51%. No significant changes in the analyzed parameters were found in the placebo group. Addition of afobazole to complex therapy of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus reduced the level of DNA damage in blood cells and improved cell resistance to oxidative genotoxic exposure.;2007-2009
130;Aerobic capacity correlates to self-assessed physical function but not to overall disease activity or organ damage in women with systemic lupus erythematosus with  low-to-moderate disease activity and organ damage.;2008;Lupus;Bostrom C;The present aim is to investigate the relationships between aerobic capacity and  disease activity, organ damage, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and physical activity in 34 women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with low-to-moderate disease activity and organ damage. Mean age was 51 (SD 10) years, disease duration 17 (SD 11) years. Aerobic capacity (maximal oxygen uptake/VO2 max) was measured with a bicycle ergometer exercise test. Overall disease activity was assessed with Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM) and the modified Systemic Lupus Erythematosus-Disease Activity Index (modified SLE-DAI),  overall organ damage with the Systemic Lupus International Collaboration Clinics/American College of Rheumatology-Damage Index, [SLICC/(ACR)-DI], HRQL with the 36-item Short-form health-survey (SF-36) and physical activity with a self-assessed question. The women who were low-to-moderately physically active had 89-92% (P < or = 0.001) of VO2 max predicted for sedentary women. Maximal oxygen uptake (L/min, mL/min/kg) correlated to SF-36 physical function (rs = 0.49, rs = 0.72) (P < or = 0.01), but not (rs < or = 0.25) to other HRQL scales,  overall disease activity or organ damage or physical activity. The correlation between aerobic capacity and physical function and the absence of correlation between aerobic capacity and physical activity, suggest a possible disease-related factor behind the low aerobic capacity. However, with no correlation between aerobic capacity and overall disease activity and organ damage, low physical activity may contribute to the low aerobic capacity in our sample.;2007-2009
131;B cell depletion therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus: relationships among serum B lymphocyte stimulator levels, autoantibody profile and clinical response.;2008;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Cambridge G;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationships between serum B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) levels, autoantibody profile and clinical response in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) following rituximab-based B cell depletion therapy (BCDT). METHODS: A total of 25 patients with active refractory SLE were followed for >or=1 year following BCDT. Disease activity was assessed using the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) system, and serum levels of BLyS and autoantibodies to dsDNA and extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) measured by ELISA. Serum immunoglobulins and anti-dsDNA antibodies were assessed for expression of the 9G4 idiotope (indicating VH4-34 germline gene origin). RESULTS: Following BCDT, all patients depleted in the peripheral blood and improved clinically for >or=3 months. Pre-BCDT BLyS levels were quantifiable (median 1.9 ng/ml) in 18/25  patients and rose in most patients at 3 months post-BCDT (median 4.15 ng/ml). Nine patients, all with quantifiable pre-BCDT serum BLyS, experienced a disease flare within 1 year. This group of patients was more likely to harbour anti-Ro/SSA antibodies (odds ratio 1.76; p = 0.06) with higher serum levels (p =  0.0027; Mann-Whitney U test). Serum levels of anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP)/Sm were also higher in this group (p<0.05). Expression of VH4-34 by serum immunoglobulins and anti-dsDNA antibodies had no predictive value for the length  of clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SLE with an expanded autoantibody profile and raised BLyS levels at baseline had shorter clinical responses to BCDT. This may reflect a greater propensity to, and degree of, epitope spreading in such patients and suggests that treatment regimens beyond BCDT may be necessary to induce long-lasting clinical remissions in these individuals.";2007-2009
132;Abetimus sodium for renal flare in systemic lupus erythematosus: results of a randomized, controlled phase III trial.;2008;Arthritis and rheumatism;Cardiel MH;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether treatment with abetimus delays renal flare in patients with lupus nephritis. Secondary objectives included evaluation of the effect of abetimus on C3 levels, anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels, use of high-dose corticosteroids and/or cyclophosphamide, and major systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flare. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled study of treatment with abetimus at 100 mg/week for up to 22 months in SLE patients. Three hundred seventeen patients with a history of renal  flare and anti-dsDNA levels >15 IU/ml were randomized to a treatment group (158 abetimus, 159 placebo); 298 (94%) were enrolled in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (145 abetimus, 153 placebo), based on the presence of high-affinity antibodies for the oligonucleotide epitope of abetimus at baseline screening. RESULTS: Abetimus did not significantly prolong time to renal flare, time to initiation of high-dose corticosteroid and/or cyclophosphamide treatment, or time to major SLE flare. However, there were 25% fewer renal flares in the abetimus group compared with the placebo group (17 of 145 abetimus-treated patients [12%]  versus 24 of 153 placebo-treated patients [16%]). Abetimus treatment decreased anti-dsDNA antibody levels (P < 0.0001), and reductions in anti-dsDNA levels were associated with increases in C3 levels (P < 0.0001). More patients in the abetimus group experienced > or =50% reductions in proteinuria at 1 year, compared with the placebo group (nominal P = 0.047). Trends toward reduced rates  of renal flare and major SLE flare were noted in patients treated with abetimus who had impaired renal function at baseline. Treatment with abetimus for up to 22 months was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Abetimus at 100 mg/week significantly reduced anti-dsDNA antibody levels but did not significantly prolong time to renal flare when compared with placebo. Multiple positive trends in renal end points were observed in the abetimus treatment group.";2007-2009
133;Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors delay the occurrence of renal involvement and are associated with a decreased risk of disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus--results from LUMINA (LIX): a multiethnic US cohort.;2008;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Duran-Barragan S;"OBJECTIVE: To examine if angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use delays the occurrence of renal involvement and decreases the risk of disease activity in SLE patients. METHODS: SLE patients (Hispanics, African Americans and Caucasians) from the lupus in minorities: nature vs nurture (LUMINA) cohort were studied. Renal involvement was defined as ACR criterion and/or biopsy-proven lupus nephritis. Time-to-renal involvement was examined by univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Disease activity was  examined with a case-crossover design and a conditional logistic regression model; in the case intervals, a decrease in the SLAM-R score >or=4 points occurred but not in the control intervals. RESULTS: Eighty of 378 patients (21%)  were ACE inhibitor users; 298 (79%) were not. The probability of renal involvement free-survival at 10 yrs was 88.1% for users and 75.4% for non-users (P = 0.0099, log rank test). Users developed persistent proteinuria and/or biopsy-proven lupus nephritis (7.1%) less frequently than non-users (22.9%), P =  0.016. By multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, ACE inhibitors use [hazard ratio (HR) 0.27; 95% CI 0.09, 0.78] was associated with a  longer time-to-renal involvement occurrence whereas African American ethnicity (HR 3.31; 95% CI 1.44, 7.61) was with a shorter time. ACE inhibitor use (54/288 case and 254/1148 control intervals) was also associated with a decreased risk of disease activity (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.34, 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: ACE inhibitor use delays the development of renal involvement and associates with a decreased risk  of disease activity in SLE; corroboration of these findings in other lupus cohorts is desirable before practice recommendations are formulated.";2007-2009
134;Steroid-sparing effects of methotrexate in systemic lupus erythematosus: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.;2008;Arthritis and rheumatism;Fortin PR;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential benefits of methotrexate in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of methotrexate with folic acid was conducted. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed with mixed linear models and alpha = 0.04 (96% confidence interval [96% CI]) to account for interim analysis of longitudinal data to assess the treatment effects on lupus disease activity and daily steroid dose across monthly measurements, and to test if the treatment effects depended on selected participant characteristics. RESULTS: Of 215 participants screened, 94 were excluded, 35 declined, and 86 were randomized (methotrexate = 41, placebo = 45). The groups were balanced for demographic and disease characteristics. Antimalarial use was more frequent in the placebo group, which was adjusted for in multivariable analyses. Sixty participants (27 methotrexate, 33 placebo) completed the study and 26 terminated early. Among participants who had the same baseline prednisone dose, those taking methotrexate received, on average, 1.33 mg/day less prednisone during the trial period (96% CI 0.06, 2.72 mg/day; a 22% reduction of their average-during-trial daily dose) compared with those in the placebo group. For the primary measure of disease activity (revised Systemic Lupus Activity Measure), methotrexate use was also associated with a marginally significant reduction in the mean during-trial score of 0.86 units (96% CI 0.01, 1.71; P = 0.039). A significant interaction between treatment and baseline damage was found (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Methotrexate conferred a significant advantage in participants with moderately active lupus by lowering daily prednisone dose and slightly decreasing lupus disease activity. As a therapeutic option in moderate SLE, methotrexate can be considered to be steroid sparing.";2007-2009

136;Testosterone patches in the management of patients with mild/moderate systemic lupus erythematosus.;2008;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Gordon C;OBJECTIVES: Androgen deficiency has been associated with the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of testosterone patches vs placebo in female SLE patients with baseline  mild-to-moderate disease activity in a randomized, double-blind, single-centre placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Patients received testosterone (150 microg) or placebo transdermal patches for 12 weeks. Patients were assessed at 4-weekly intervals for disease activity using the Safety of Oestrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI), Systemic Lupus Activity Measure-Revised (SLAM-R) and The British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) indices, physician global assessment (PGA), quality of life using the SF-36 survey and sexual functioning using the Derogatis score. Data were analysed using two sample t-tests to compare the mean difference from baseline to week 12 in the testosterone patch and placebo groups. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were recruited in to each group. There was no significant baseline difference between the groups in age, race or marital status. There was  no significant difference between treatment groups in the mean change in SELENA-SLEDAI (0.547 +/- 3.72, P > 0.60), nor in PGA or BILAG system scores. The  mean change in SLAM-R score was statistically different (2.06, S.D. 3.3, P = 0.01) but was not considered clinically meaningful. Health transition also showed a small change (P < 0.03). There was no significant difference in the Derogatis scores or toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone patches were safe but did not significantly affect disease activity, quality of life or sexual functioning. Increased use of steroids in the placebo group may have confounded the study results.;2007-2009
137;Acupuncture for systemic lupus erythematosus: a pilot RCT feasibility and safety  study.;2008;Lupus;Greco CM;The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of studying acupuncture in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and to pilot test the safety and explore benefits of a standardized acupuncture protocol designed to reduce pain and fatigue. Twenty-four patients with SLE were randomly  assigned to receive 10 sessions of either acupuncture, minimal needling or usual  care. Pain, fatigue and SLE disease activity were assessed at baseline and following the last sessions. Safety was assessed at each session. Fifty-two patients were screened to enroll 24 eligible and interested persons. Although transient side effects, such as brief needling pain and lightheadedness, were reported, no serious adverse events were associated with either the acupuncture or minimal needling procedures. Twenty-two participants completed the study, and  the majority (85%) of acupuncture and minimal needling participants were able to  complete their sessions within the specified time period of 5-6 weeks. 40% of patients who received acupuncture or minimal needling had >/=30% improvement on standard measures of pain, but no usual care patients showed improvement in pain. A ten-session course of acupuncture appears feasible and safe for patients with SLE. Benefits were similar for acupuncture and minimal needling.;2007-2009
138;MAGE-B2 autoantibody: a new biomarker for pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus.;2008;The Journal of rheumatology;Hoftman AD;"OBJECTIVE: Melanoma-associated antigen gene B2 (MAGE-B2) encodes an embryonic antigen normally silenced after birth except in testis and placenta. We identified the MAGE-B2 gene and autoantibodies in pediatric patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) glomerulonephritis. We investigated the prevalence of MAGE-B2 autoantibodies in association with active SLE, to determine a pathogenetic role of MAGE-B2 protein through its distribution in cells and tissues. METHODS: A cross-sectional study analyzed the frequency of MAGE-B2 autoantibodies in 40 patients with pediatric SLE, 23 adult controls, and 16 patients with pediatric juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) using Western blots containing recombinant MAGE-B2. SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) index measured SLE disease activity. Tissue distribution of MAGE-B2 protein was assessed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blots. RESULTS: Seventeen (43%) of 40 pediatric SLE patients had MAGE-B2 autoantibodies as compared to 0 of 16 JRA patients and 2 of 23 adult controls. SLE disease activity was significantly higher in MAGE-B2 autoantibody-positive versus autoantibody-negative patients (SLEDAI-2K, mean 10.9 vs 5.2, p = 0.013; BILAG, mean 15.3 vs 6.3, p = 0.023). Active nephritis was more prevalent (60% vs 24%) in MAGE-B2 autoantibody-positive than autoantibody-negative SLE patients. MAGE-B2 protein was visualized in SLE kidney  proximal convoluted tubules and in tumor epithelial cells, but not in lymphoblastoid cells. CONCLUSION: MAGE-B2 autoantibody appears to be a clinically relevant biomarker for pediatric SLE disease activity and nephritis.";2007-2009
139;Effect of Lipo-PGE1 on health-related quality of life in patients with systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus in Japan.;2008;The Journal of international medical research;Hoshi K;We investigated the effect of Lipo-PGE(1), a prostaglandin (PG) E(1) preparation  used to treat cutaneous ulcers associated with systemic sclerosis (SS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), on health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) using the Medical Outcome Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. A total of 192 SS and SLE patients were treated for 3 months. At baseline the scores for each of the five SF-36 subscales were significantly lower than the age- and sex-adjusted standard values for the Japanese general population. After treatment, mean (+/- SD) SF-36 scores for body pain and general health perception significantly increased from 48.6 +/- 24.1 to 55.3 +/- 26.1 and from 36.8 +/- 16.7 to 40.2 +/- 17, respectively. Emotional QOL parameters including vitality and mental health, however, showed no improvement. Physician-rated symptom scores significantly improved after administration of Lipo-PGE(1). In conclusion, Lipo-PGE(1) improved both cutaneous ulcers and HR-QOL, especially physical QOL.;2007-2009
140;Differential effects of epratuzumab on peripheral blood B cells of patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus versus normal controls.;2008;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Jacobi AM;OBJECTIVE: B lymphocytes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of lupus and other autoimmune diseases, resulting in the introduction of B cell-directed therapies. Epratuzumab, a humanised anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody, is currently in clinical trials, although its effects on patients' B cells are not completely  understood. METHODS: This study analysed the in vivo effect of epratuzumab on peripheral B cell subsets in 12 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and also addressed the in vitro effects of the drug by analysing anti-immunoglobulin-induced proliferation of isolated B cells obtained from the peripheral blood of 11 additional patients with lupus and seven normal subjects.  RESULTS: Upon treatment, a pronounced reduction of CD27(-) B cells and CD22 surface expression on CD27(-) B cells was observed, suggesting that these cells,  which mainly comprise naive and transitional B cells, are preferentially targeted by epratuzumab in vivo. The results of in vitro studies indicate additional regulatory effects of the drug by reducing the enhanced activation and proliferation of anti-immunoglobulin-stimulated lupus B cells after co-incubation with CD40L or CpG. Epratuzumab inhibited the proliferation of B cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus but not normal B cells under all culture conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Epratuzumab preferentially modulates the exaggerated activation and proliferation of B cells from patients with lupus in contrast to normal subjects, thus suggesting that epratuzumab might offer a new therapeutic option for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, as enhanced B  cell activation is a hallmark of this disease.;2007-2009
141;Treatment of refractory SLE with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide: clinical effects, serological changes, and predictors of response.;2008;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Jonsdottir T;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy, serological responses, and predictors of response in patients with severe and refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide. METHODS: 16 patients entered  a treatment protocol using rituximab plus cyclophosphamide. Disease activity was  assessed by the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) and by the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) index. RESULTS: At six months follow up, mean SLEDAI values decreased significantly from (mean (SD)) 12.1 (2.2) to 4.7 (1.1). Clinical improvement (50% reduction in SLEDAI) occurred in all but three patients. All but one patient responded according to BILAG. Remission defined as  SLEDAI <3 was achieved in nine of 16 patients. Isotype analysis of anti-dsDNA antibodies revealed preferential decreases of IgG and IgA, but not IgM. Higher absolute numbers of CD19+ cells at baseline were correlated with shorter depletion time (r = -0.6). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients improved following rituximab plus cyclophosphamide. The differential downregulation of anti-DNA of the IgG and IgA but not the IgM isotypes supports the hypothesis that cells producing pathogenic autoantibodies are preferentially targeted by the treatment. The fact that greater absolute numbers of CD19+ cells at baseline predict a less impressive clinical and serological response suggests that more flexible dosing could be advantageous.;2007-2009
142;Differential expression and molecular associations of Syk in systemic lupus erythematosus T cells.;2008;Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950);Krishnan S;"Diminished expression of TCR zeta and reciprocal up-regulation and association of FcRgamma with the TCR/CD3 complex is a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) T cells. In this study we explored whether differential molecular associations of the spleen tyrosine kinase Syk that preferentially binds to FcRgamma contribute to pathological amplification of signals downstream of this ""rewired TCR"" in SLE. We detected higher amounts of Syk expression and activity in SLE compared with normal T cells. Selective inhibition of the activity of Syk  reduced the strength of TCR-induced calcium responses and slowed the rapid kinetics of actin polymerization exclusively in SLE T cells. Syk and ZAP-70 also  associated differently with key molecules involved in cytoskeletal and calcium signaling in SLE T cells. Thus, while Vav-1 and LAT preferentially bound to Syk,  phospholipase C-gamma1 bound to both Syk and ZAP-70. Our results show that differential associations of Syk family kinases contribute to the enhanced TCR-induced signaling responses in SLE T cells. Thus, we propose molecular targeting of Syk as a measure to control abnormal T cell responses in SLE.";2007-2009
143;Poor 1-year outcomes after percutaneous coronary interventions in systemic lupus  erythematosus: report from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Dynamic  Registry.;2008;Circulation. Cardiovascular interventions;Maksimowicz-McKinnon K;"BACKGROUND: Women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have premature and accelerated atherosclerosis. Although percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is used frequently to treat coronary artery disease in SLE, little is known regarding PCI outcomes immediately after PCI and after discharge. METHODS AND RESULTS: Baseline demographic, procedure-related, and adverse outcome data on consecutive patients undergoing PCI during 5 recruitment ""waves"" of the National  Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Dynamic Registry across 23 clinical centers were collected. SLE patients (n=28) were compared with non-SLE patients (n=3385). SLE  patients were younger and more often female in comparison with non-SLE patients undergoing PCI. SLE patients were less likely than non-SLE patients to have hyperlipidemia but had a similar prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and tobacco use. The prevalence of multivessel disease was similar between groups. Initial intervention success (by angiographic definition) was not significantly different between groups. At 1 year, SLE patients were more likely  to experience a myocardial infarction (15.6% versus 4.8%, P=0.01) and more often  required repeat PCI (31.3% versus 11.8%, P=0.009) than non-SLE patients, even after adjustment for important covariates. CONCLUSIONS: SLE patients had significantly worse cardiovascular outcomes at 1 year than non-SLE patients. Even considering the small number of SLE patients, these differences were striking. Further study is warranted to explore other factors potentially accounting for this disparity, including SLE disease activity and duration, presence of hypercoagulable state, and immunosuppressive therapy.";2007-2009
144;Health-related quality of life in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and  its relationship with cyclophosphamide pulse therapy.;2008;European journal of internal medicine;Medeiros MM;OBJECTIVES: To examine health-related quality of life in Brazilian patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and compare patients using cyclophosphamide (CP) pulse therapy with those who do not use it. METHODS: Patients with SLE using or not CP completed the SF-36 and SRQ-20 (psychological morbidity) questionnaire. The Lupus Activity Criteria Count (LAAC) assessed SLE disease activity. RESULTS:  We studied 102 patients with SLE. The presence of psychological morbidity was associated with all the scores from SF-36. The physical component summary (PCS) of the SF-36 was significantly lower in patients with activity disease and the mental component summary (MCS) was significantly lower in the patients with psychological morbidity. Comparing patients using or not CP, it was not observed  in a statistical significant difference in the 8 domains of the SF-36, nor in the PCS and MCS between the two groups. The prevalence of psychological morbidity evaluated by the SRQ-20 has not presented a statistical significant difference between the patients using or not CP. In the multivariate analysis, using the PCS and MCS as separate dependent variables, the most important variable associated with them was psychological morbidity. CONCLUSION: Cyclophosphamide pulse therapy does not worse health-related quality of life in patients with SLE. The presence  of psychological distress is an important factor associated with worse quality of life.;2007-2009

A total of 509 cases and 964 controls of Japanese descent were enrolled. RESULTS: A total of 316 SNPs was identified. When analysed in the Japanese population, the allele frequencies of T at rs7951 and G  at rs2230201 of the C3 gene were 0.110 and 0.626, respectively, in SLE patients;  significantly higher than the frequencies of 0.081 and 0.584, respectively, in controls [odds ratio (OR) = 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-1.86, P = 0.016 and OR=1.19, 95% CI = 1.01-1.41, P = 0.038, respectively]. The mean serum C3 level of carriers of the rs7951 T allele was significantly lower than that of  non-carriers of the T allele in 87 SLE patients whose medical records were available (P = 0.0018). CONCLUSION: rs7951 T allele of the C3 gene was significantly associated with SLE, and decreased serum level of C3 seems to be correlated with this allele.";2007-2009
146;Spliceosomal peptide P140 for immunotherapy of systemic lupus erythematosus: results of an early phase II clinical trial.;2008;Arthritis and rheumatism;Muller S;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of spliceosomal peptide P140 (IPP-201101; sequence 131-151 of the U1-70K protein phosphorylated at Ser140), which is recognized by lupus CD4+ T cells, in the treatment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: An open-label, dose-escalation phase II study was conducted in two centers in Bulgaria. Twenty patients (2 male and 18 female) with moderately active SLE received 3 subcutaneous (SC) administrations of a clinical batch of P140 peptide at 2-week intervals. Clinical evaluation was performed using approved scales. A panel of autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibodies, antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens (U1 RNP, SmD1, Ro/SSA, La/SSB), and antibodies to double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), chromatin, cardiolipin, and peptides of the U1-70K protein, was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The plasma levels of C-reactive protein, total Ig, IgG, IgG subclasses, IgM, IgA, and IgE, and of the cytokines interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured by ELISA and nephelometry. RESULTS: IgG anti-dsDNA antibody levels decreased by at least 20% in 7 of 10 patients who received 3 x 200 microg IPP-201101 (group 1), but only in 1 patient in the group receiving 3 x 1,000 microg IPP-201101 (group 2). Physician's global assessment of disease activity scores and scores on the SLE Disease Activity Index were significantly decreased  in group 1. The changes occurred progressively in the population of responders, increased in magnitude during the treatment period, and were sustained. No clinical or biologic adverse effects were observed in the individuals, except for some local irritation at the highest concentration. CONCLUSION: IPP-201101 was found to be safe and well tolerated by subjects. Three SC doses of IPP-201101 at  200 microg significantly improved the clinical and biologic status of lupus patients.";2007-2009
147;Fulvestrant (Faslodex), an estrogen selective receptor downregulator, in therapy  of women with systemic lupus erythematosus. clinical, serologic, bone density, and T cell activation marker studies: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial.;2008;The Journal of rheumatology;Abdou NI;"OBJECTIVE: Estrogen plays a role in the activation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and in upregulating intracellular signals by binding to the estrogen receptor(s). Fulvestrant (Faslodex, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE, USA), an estrogen selective receptor downregulator, competes for  receptor binding in vitro and inhibits estrogen action in target cells. We evaluated the efficacy, side effects, and expression of T cell activation markers, following the administration of fulvestrant or placebo to premenopausal  patients with SLE. METHODS: Twenty women with moderate SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI; 7.87 +/- 3.7) were enrolled. They were premenopausal with regular menstrual cycles and not taking exogenous hormones. The study was double-blind and placebo-controlled. Ten patients received 250 mg fulvestrant intramuscularly  for 12 months, and 10 received the placebo. All were observed monthly and 3 months after final fulvestrant/placebo injection. Measures studied were monthly SLEDAI scores, routine and serologic markers for lupus, and serum concentrations  of estrogen and fulvestrant. Expression of T cell calcineurin and CD154 mRNA in peripheral T cells was measured by polymerase chain reaction. Medications the patients were taking were recorded each visit. Bone density was obtained at baseline and at visit 12. RESULTS: Sixteen patients completed the 15-month study, 8 from each group. SLEDAI improved significantly in the fulvestrant group at both 12 months (p = 0.02) and 15 months (p = 0.002), but serologic markers, routine laboratory tests, and bone density did not. Serum estrogen levels were higher in  the fulvestrant group and dropped when fulvestrant was discontinued; these differences were not statistically significant. Medications for therapy of lupus  to the fulvestrant group were reduced, whereas the placebo group medications were unchanged or increased. Comparison of relative values at individual timepoints revealed significantly lower median values for the T cell activation markers CD154 (p < 0.001) and calcineurin (p = 0.013) in the fulvestrant arm. CONCLUSION: Blocking estrogen receptors in vivo by an estrogen selective receptor downregulator could be considered as a new and relatively safe therapeutic approach in the management of SLE patients with moderately active disease for the 1-year study period.

148;Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in pregnant patients affected with systemic lupus erythematosus and recurrent spontaneous abortion.;2008;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Perricone R;OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test the maternal and fetal outcome of SLE patients who suffered from recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) alone during pregnancy and whether the clinical response to IVIg treatment is accompanied by modifications of SLE-associated antibodies and of complement levels. METHODS: Twelve SLE-RSA pregnant patients were treated with high-dose IVIg and compared with 12 SLE-RSA pregnant patients treated with prednisolone and NSAIDs. They were evaluated for the clinical response [lupus activity index-pregnancy (LAI-P) scale] and for ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti Ro/SS-A or  La/SS-B, aCL, LAC, C4, C3 before and during pregnancy, and before and after each  treatment course. Pregnancy outcome in the two groups was also evaluated. RESULTS: The groups characteristics were homogeneous at the beginning of pregnancy. A beneficial clinical response following IVIg treatment was noted in all patients and mean LAI-P decreased from 0.72 +/- 0.43 at the beginning of pregnancy to 0.13 +/- 0.19 at the end of pregnancy (P < 0.0001). Antibodies and complement levels tended to normalize in most of the patients. These clinical and laboratory improvements were significant with respect to the control group. Pregnancy was successfully carried out in 12/12 (100%) SLE-RSA patients with a mean Apgar score of 8.92. Three patients in the control group got aborted (25%).  CONCLUSIONS: IVIg has a high response rate among SLE-RSA pregnant patients and may be considered safe and effective.;2007-2009
149;Association of plasma B lymphocyte stimulator levels and disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2008;Arthritis and rheumatism;Petri M;"OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of plasma B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS)  levels, immunosuppressive therapy, and other clinical parameters with disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Two hundred forty-five SLE patients were evaluated prospectively over a 2-year period at 4 centers. Assessments were performed every 3-6 months. Univariate analysis was used to determine the association among the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus: National Assessment (SELENA) version of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease  Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, serum anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), and plasma BLyS levels. A multivariate repeated-measures model incorporating immunosuppressive therapy was utilized. RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of the patients were female. Sixty-seven percent were white, 31% African American, and 2% Asian (all of these groups may include Hispanic). Mean values at baseline were as follows: age 41.5 years, disease duration 8.1 years, SELENA-SLEDAI 3.3 (median 2, range 0-18), BLyS 5.57 ng/ml, IgG 1,439 mg/dl, C3 104.4 mg/dl, and C4 21.3 mg/dl; among those positive for anti-dsDNA, the median titer was 1:40 (range 1:10-1:1,280). Univariate analysis showed that plasma BLyS levels were associated with anti-dsDNA titers (P = 0.0465) and SELENA-SLEDAI scores (P = 0.0002). In multivariate analyses, a greater increase in the SELENA-SLEDAI score from the previous visit was associated with higher BLyS levels at the previous visit (P =  0.0042) and with a greater increase in the BLyS level from the previous visit (P  = 0.0007). CONCLUSION: The findings of association between a greater increase in  the BLyS level from the previous visit and a greater increase in the SELENA-SLEDAI score at the subsequent visit, and between an elevated BLyS level at the previous visit and a greater SELENA-SLEDAI score at the subsequent visit,  demonstrate a relationship between circulating BLyS levels and SLE disease activity. These results lend support to the notion that BLyS is a candidate for therapeutic targeting in SLE.";2007-2009
150;Time to seizure occurrence and damage in PROFILE, a multi-ethnic systemic lupus erythematosus cohort.;2008;Lupus;Ramsey-Goldman R;"The objective of this study was to determine risk factors predicting seizures and damage caused by seizures in a multi-ethnic systemic lupus erythematosus cohort (PROFILE) that includes systemic lupus erythematosus patients (n = 1295) from five different US institutions. Only patients with seizures after systemic lupus  erythematosus diagnosis (incident) were included in the analyses of clinical seizures (80/1295, 6.2%), but all patients (prevalent and incident) were included in the analyses of damage caused by seizures (51/1295, 3.9%). We examined socioeconomic-demographic, clinical, and genetic variables predictive of clinical seizures and damage from seizures by Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) and 95%  confidence intervals (CI). Independent predictors of a shorter time to the occurrence of clinical seizures were younger age (HR = 1.0; 95% CI 0.9-1.0), having Hispanic-Texan ethnicity (HR = 2.7; 95% CI 1.3-5.7) or African-American ethnicity (HR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.0-3.1), and the previous occurrence of a cerebrovascular accident (HR = 3.3; 95% CI 1.6-7.1) or an episode of psychosis (HR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.1-5.0), whereas the previous occurrence of photosensitivity (HR = 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-0.9) was the only independent predictor of a longer time to the occurrence of clinical seizures. Independent predictors of a shorter time to  the occurrence of damage caused by seizures were younger age (HR = 1.0; 95% CI 0.9-1.0), male gender (HR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.1-5.4), and the occurrence of a previous cerebrovascular accident (HR = 2.7; 95% CI 1.0-7.0) or an episode of psychosis (HR = 4.7; 95% CI 2.3-9.9).

151;Effects of prasterone on bone mineral density in women with active systemic lupus erythematosus receiving chronic glucocorticoid therapy.;2008;The Journal of rheumatology;Sanchez-Guerrero J;"OBJECTIVE: To assess prevention of bone mineral density (BMD) loss and durability of the response during treatment with prasterone in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) receiving chronic glucocorticoids. METHODS: 155 patients with SLE received 200 mg/day prasterone or placebo for 6 months in a double-blind phase. Subsequently, 114 patients were re-randomized to receive 200 or 100 mg/day prasterone for 12 months in an open-label phase. Primary efficacy endpoints were  changes in BMD at the lumbar spine (L-spine) from baseline to Month 6 and maintenance of BMD from Month 6 to 18 for patients who received prasterone during the double-blind phase. RESULTS: In the double-blind phase, there was a trend for a small gain in BMD at the L-spine for patients who received 200 mg/day prasterone for 6 months versus a loss in the placebo group (mean +/- SD, 0.003 +/- 0.035 vs -0.005 +/- 0.053 g/cm(2), respectively; p = 0.293 between groups). In the open-label phase, there was dose-dependent increase in BMD at the L-spine  at Month 18 between patients who received 200 versus 100 mg/day prasterone (p = 0.021). For patients who received 200 mg/day prasterone for 18 months, the L-spine BMD gain was 1.083 +/- 0.512% (p = 0.042). There was no overall change in BMD at the total hip over 18 months with 200 mg/day prasterone treatment. The safety profile reflected the weak androgenic properties of prasterone. CONCLUSION: This study suggests prasterone 200 mg/day may offer mild protection against bone loss in women with SLE receiving glucocorticoids.

152;Pregnancy outcome in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus: a Brazilian multicenter cohort study.;2008;The Journal of rheumatology;Silva CA;"OBJECTIVE: To determine pregnancy outcome and fetal loss risk factors in patients with juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE). METHODS: A total of 315 female patients with JSLE followed in 12 Brazilian pediatric rheumatology centers were consecutively selected. Menarche was observed in 298 (94.6%) patients. Patients'  medical records were reviewed for pregnancy outcomes and demographic, clinical, and therapeutic data. RESULTS: A total of 24 unplanned pregnancies occurred in 298 (8%) patients. The outcomes were 5 (21%) early fetal losses (prior to 16 wks  gestation), 18 (75%) live births, and 1 (4%) death due to preeclampsia and premature birth. The frequencies of active diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, proteinuria > or = 0.5 g/day, and arterial hypertension at the beginning of pregnancy were higher in pregnancies resulting in fetal losses than in live births [60% vs 5% (p = 0.02), 60% vs 5% (p = 0.02), 60% vs 5% (p = 0.02), respectively]. JSLE pregnancies with fetal losses had a significantly higher mean SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) at the start of pregnancy compared with those with live births (9.40 +/- 7.47 vs 3.94 +/- 6.00; p = 0.049). Four pregnancies were inadvertently exposed to intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy for renal involvement despite contraceptive prescriptions, resulting in fetal loss in 3 (p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis only intravenous cyclophosphamide use at start of pregnancy (OR 25.50, 95% CI 1.72-377.93, p = 0.019) remained as an independent risk factor for fetal loss. CONCLUSION: We identified immunosuppressive therapy as the major contributing factor for fetal loss in JSLE, reinforcing the importance of contraception.";2007-2009
153;Concordant and discordant associations between rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and ankylosing spondylitis based on all hospitalizations in Sweden between 1973 and 2004.;2008;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Sundquist K;OBJECTIVES: To quantify the sibling risk of RA, SLE and AS. To analyse the concordant and discordant associations between RA, SLE and AS. METHODS: Follow-up study of all individuals and their siblings born in or after 1932 and hospitalized for RA, SLE or AS between 1973 and 2004 (32 yrs). Data were retrieved from a comprehensive dataconstructed by using several national Swedish  data registers, including the Total Population Register, the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and the Multigeneration Register. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to estimate sibling risks. RESULTS: For males, the overall significant SIRs were 4.72, 4.35 and 4.14 for RA, SLE and AS, respectively, if a sibling was affected by any inflammatory disease. The corresponding significant SIRs for females were 4.12, 3.73 and 4.73. The concordant significant SIRs in siblings were 5.12, 17.02 and 17.14 for RA, SLE and AS, respectively. There were also discordant associations between RA and SLE, whereas AS was only associated with AS. CONCLUSIONS: This study was able objectively to quantify the sibling risk of RA, SLE and AS, which represents useful knowledge for clinicians and geneticists. The analysis of concordant and discordant associations may be useful in future studies aimed at finding specific genes associated with these diseases.;2007-2009
154;A longitudinal analysis of SLE patients treated with rituximab (anti-CD20): factors associated with B lymphocyte recovery.;2008;Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.);Sutter JA;Identifying factors associated with B lymphocyte depletion and recovery may aid the development of individualized treatment regimens, optimizing therapy for patients with autoimmune disease. In this study, 12 patients with active SLE were monitored at baseline and monthly following treatment with rituximab. The number  and phenotype of peripheral blood B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and natural killer cells were correlated with the extent and longevity of B lymphocyte depletion. This analysis generated three candidate biomarkers for lymphocyte monitoring in patients with autoimmune disease who are treated with rituximab: circulating transitional B cells, the kappa:lambda ratio and natural killer cells. Further refinement of these potential biomarkers may lead to a better understanding of the role of B cells in disease pathogenesis and a more rational use of B cell depletion therapies.;2007-2009
155;A dose-escalation study of rituximab for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and Evans' syndrome: immunological analysis of B cells, T cells and cytokines.;2008;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Tamimoto Y;OBJECTIVE: Accumulating evidence suggests that B-cell depletion therapy by rituximab may be effective for autoimmune disorders. However, an optimal dose of  rituximab and a mechanism of its action remain to be established. We performed a  dose-escalation study for treatment of Japanese patients with autoimmune diseases including eight with SLE and one with Evans' syndrome. METHODS: Rituximab was infused intravenously, weekly 4 times in a dose-escalating fashion at three different doses of 100, 250 or 375 mg/m(2) to three patients each. Immunological  parameters were monitored at certain points until 12 months after the treatment.  RESULTS: Rituximab was well tolerated and safe in these patients. Seven out of eight SLE patients and one with Evans' syndrome clinically responded completely or partially to the treatment. Four patients achieved long-term remission (18-30  months) without any additional treatment. In these patients, a significant decrease in circulating B cells continued for 6 months after the treatment. The mean fluorescence intensities of CD19, CD21, CD40 and BR3 on the residual B cells as well as the percentage of CD69+ CD4+ T cells decreased significantly. Serum TNF-alpha levels decreased significantly on day 2. The Th1/Th2 balance of CD4+ T  cells gradually shifted towards a Th1 type by 6 months. CONCLUSION: In addition to B-cell depletion, modification of B-cell and T-cell phenotypes as well as cytokine profiles may be involved in the action of rituximab.;2007-2009

METHODS: Seventy patients with mild-to-moderate SLE were enrolled in a phase I, double-blind, randomized study and treated with placebo (n = 13) or belimumab (n = 57) at four different doses (1.0, 4.0, 10, and 20 mg/kg) as a single infusion or two infusions 21 days apart. Patients were followed for 84 to  105 days to assess adverse events, pharmacokinetics, peripheral blood B-cell counts, serology, and SLE disease activity. Data from the study were summarized using descriptive statistics. chi2 type tests were used to analyze discrete variables. The Kruskal-Wallis test, the Wilcoxon test, and the analysis of covariance were used to analyze the continuous variables, as appropriate. The analysis was performed on all randomized patients who received study agent. RESULTS: The incidences of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were similar among the belimumab and placebo groups. Belimumab pharmacokinetics were linear across the 1.0 to 20 mg/kg dose range. Long terminal elimination half-life (8.5 to 14.1 days), slow clearance (7 ml/day per kg), and small volume of distribution (69 to 112 ml/kg) were consistent with a fully human antibody. Significant reductions in median percentages of CD20+ B cells were observed in patients treated with a single dose of belimumab versus placebo (day 42: P = 0.0042; and day 84: P = 0.0036) and in patients treated with two doses of belimumab versus placebo (day 105: P = 0.0305). SLE disease activity did not change after one or two doses of belimumab. CONCLUSIONS: Belimumab was well tolerated and reduced peripheral B-cell levels in SLE patients. These data support further studies of belimumab in autoimmune disorders";2007-2009
157;Pharmacokinetic study of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and design of Bayesian estimator using limited sampling strategies.;2008;Clinical pharmacokinetics;Zahr N;BACKGROUND: Monitoring of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of mycophenolic acid (MPA) has been developed for individual dose adjustment of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in renal allograft recipients. MMF is currently used as an off-label drug in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but factors of its exposition may be different in these patients and need to be determined for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) purposes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to develop a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) Bayesian estimator of MPA exposition in patients with SLE, with the objective of TDM based on a limited sample strategy. METHODS: Twenty adult patients with SLE given a stable 1 g/day, 2 g/day or 3 g/day dose of MMF orally for at least 10 weeks were included in the study. MPA was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to a photodiode array detector (11 plasma measurements over 12 hours post-dose per patient). Free MPA concentrations were measured by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Two different one-compartment models with first-order elimination were tested to fit the data:  one convoluted with a double gamma distribution to describe secondary concentrations peaks, and one convoluted with a triple gamma distribution to model a third, later peak. RESULTS: A large interindividual variability in MPA concentration-time profiles was observed. The mean maximum plasma concentration,  trough plasma concentration, time to reach the maximum plasma concentration and AUC from 0 to 12 hours (AUC(12)) were 13.6 +/- 8.4 microg/mL, 1.4 +/- 1.2 microg/mL, 1.1 +/- 1.2 hours and 32.2 +/- 17.1microg . h/mL, respectively. The mean free fraction of MPA was 1.7%. The one-compartment model with first-order elimination convoluted with a triple gamma distribution best fitted the data. Accurate Bayesian estimates of the AUC(12) were obtained using three blood samples collected at 40 minutes, 2 hours and 3 hours, with a coefficient of correlation (R) = 0.95 between the observed and predicted AUC(12) and with a difference of <20% in 16 of the 20 patients. CONCLUSION: A specific pharmacokinetic model was built to accurately fit MPA blood concentration-time profiles after MMF oral dosing in SLE patients, which allowed development of an accurate Bayesian estimator of MPA exposure that should allow MMF monitoring based on the AUC(12) in these patients. The predictive value of targeting one specific or different AUC values on patients' outcome using this estimator in SLE will need to be evaluated. ;2007-2009
158;Mizoribine intermittent pulse protocol for induction therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus in children: an open-label pilot study with five newly diagnosed patients.;2008;Clinical rheumatology;Tanaka H;"The objective of the current work is to report our preliminary experience with the mizoribine (MZR) intermittent pulse protocol for induction therapy for newly  diagnosed pediatric-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Five consecutive patients who were newly diagnosed as having SLE with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis were recruited for an open-label trial of prednisolone (PDN) and MZR intermittent pulse therapy (10 mg/kg for 2 days of the week for 12 months). Data  on the renal response and serologic lupus activity were collected prospectively.  The baseline characteristics of the patients were: mean age, 11 years; urinary protein/creatinine ratio (U-prot./cre.), 0.99 +/- 0.91; serum complement hemolytic activity (CH50), 10.6 +/- 1.3 (normal, 23-46 U/ml); serum anti-dsDNA antibody titer, 258.6 +/- 125.5 IU/ml (normal, <12.0 IU/ml); serum creatinine, 0.5 +/- 0.1 mg/dl; European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement index (ECLAM), 7.4 +/- 1.1. The primary endpoint was the interval until the development of a flare of SLE. Despite gradual tapering of the PDN dose, significant improvement as compared to the baseline values was observed in all the parameters examined at 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment. After 12 months therapy, complete response was  achieved in all of the patients, except for 1 patient who showed poor drug compliance. In two patients who had severe lupus nephritis at the first renal biopsy, marked histologic improvement was confirmed at the second renal biopsy. No serious adverse effects were observed. We believe that the MZR pulse protocol  combined with PDN for induction therapy may be the treatment of choice in selected young patients with SLE. Further studies to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of our current protocol in larger numbers of patients are, however, needed.";2007-2009
159;Regulatory effect of Langchuang serial recipes on T-lymphocyte subsets Th and Tc  in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2008;Chinese journal of integrative medicine;Tao XJ;OBJECTIVE: To study the principle of clearing Fei (), cooling blood, and detoxification as well as nourishing yin and moisening Fei (abbr. as CCD-NM) in regulating the levels of peripheral T-lymphocyte subsets Th and Tc cells to explore its mechanism for lowering the incidence of infection in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Sixty SLE patients without complicated infection were assigned to the treatment group and the control group, 30 in each group. The control group was treated with Western medicine alone, while the treatment group was treated with the same program of Western medicine,  but additionally administered with either Langchuang No.1 (I) or 2 (II), serial concerted Chinese recipes, applied respectively in patients in the active stage or in the resting stage. The total time of treatment for both groups was 1 year.  Further, a healthy control group was set up with 20 healthy subjects. The expressions of Th1, Th2, and Tc1 and Tc2 cells in peripheral blood were detected  and compared with those in the healthy control group. RESULTS: (1) As compared with the healthy control group, ratios of Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 in SLE patients, whether complicated with infection or not, were significantly lower (P<0.05 or P<0.01). (2) Comparison between patients with complications and those uncomplicated with infection showed that the two ratios and Th1 expression were lower and Tc2 was higher in the former than those in the latter (all P<0.05). (3) Ratios of Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 increased after treatment in patients of both the treatment group and the control group (P<0.05 and P<0.01), but the changes in the treatment group were more significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The principle of CCD-NM could regulate the Th and Tc subsets toward equilibrium in SLE patients, which might be one of the mechanisms of action for alleviating complicated infection.;2007-2009
160;Copy number of FCGR3B, which is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, correlates with protein expression and immune complex uptake.;2008;The Journal of experimental medicine;Willcocks LC;Copy number (CN) variation (CNV) has been shown to be common in regions of the genome coding for immune-related genes, and thus impacts upon polygenic autoimmunity. Low CN of FCGR3B has recently been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). FcgammaRIIIb is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked, low affinity receptor for IgG found predominantly on human neutrophils. We present novel data demonstrating that both in a family with FcgammaRIIIb-deficiency and in the normal population, FCGR3B CNV correlates with protein expression, with neutrophil uptake of and adherence to immune complexes, and with soluble serum FcgammaRIIIb. Reduced FcgammaRIIIb expression is thus likely to contribute to the impaired clearance of immune complexes, which is a feature of SLE, explaining the association between low FCGR3B CNV and SLE that we have confirmed in a Caucasian  population. In contrast, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated systemic  vasculitis (AASV), a disease not associated with immune complex deposition, is associated with high FCGR3B CN. Thus, we define a role for FCGR3B CNV in immune complex clearance, a function that may explain why low FCGR3B CNV is associated with SLE, but not AASV. This is the first report of an association between disease-related gene CNV and variation in protein expression and function that may contribute to autoimmune disease susceptibility.;2007-2009

RESULTS: In the fish oil group there was a significant improvement at 24 weeks in SLAM-R (from 9.4 (SD 3.0) to 6.3 (2.5), p<0.001); in BILAG (from 13.6 (6.0) to 6.7 (3.8), p<0.001); in FMD (from 3.0% (-0.5 to 8.2) to 8.9% (1.3 to 16.9), p<0.001) and in  platelet 8-isoprostanes (from 177 pg/mg protein (23-387) to 90 pg/mg protein (32-182), p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose dietary supplementation with omega-3  fish oils in systemic lupus erythematosus not only has a therapeutic effect on disease activity but also improves endothelial function and reduces oxidative stress and may therefore confer cardiovascular benefits.";2007-2009
162;A comparison of calcium, calcitriol, and alendronate in corticosteroid-treated premenopausal patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2008;The Journal of rheumatology;Yeap SS;OBJECTIVE: To assess bone mineral density (BMD) changes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) undergoing longterm therapy with corticosteroids (CS) while taking calcium, calcitriol, or alendronate. The primary endpoint was BMD changes at 2 years. METHODS: Premenopausal SLE patients were randomized into 3 groups according to medication: calcium carbonate 500 mg bd (calcium alone), calcitriol 0.25 microg bd plus calcium carbonate 500 mg bd (calcitriol + calcium), and alendronate 70 mg/week plus calcium carbonate 500 mg bd (alendronate + calcium). BMD was measured at baseline and at the end of the first and second years. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were recruited. There were 33 patients taking calcium alone, 33 calcitriol + calcium, and 32 alendronate + calcium. On randomization, median duration of CS use was 2.5 years (range 0-20 yrs). Seventy-seven patients (78.6%) completed the study (23 taking calcium alone, 27 calcitriol + calcium, 27 alendronate + calcium). There were no significant differences in mean CS dosages among the 3 groups at the time of BMD  measurements. After 2 years, there were no significant changes in BMD in the calcium-alone and calcitriol + calcium groups, apart from a 0.93% (p < 0.001) reduction in total hip BMD in the calcium-alone group. In contrast, the alendronate + calcium group showed significant increases in BMD of 2.69% (p < 0.001) in the lumbar spine and 1.41% (p < 0.001) in total hip. CONCLUSION: Both calcium alone and calcitriol + calcium preserved lumbar spine BMD in premenopausal patients with SLE taking longterm CS at 2 years, whereas alendronate + calcium led to increases in BMD in lumbar spine and total hip. Premenopausal women taking CS should be considered for osteoporosis prophylaxis.;2007-2009
163;BILAG-2004 index captures systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity better than SLEDAI-2000.;2008;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Yee CS;OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)-2000 index in routine practice and its ability to capture disease activity as compared with the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-2004 index. METHODS: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus from 11 centres were assessed separately by two raters in routine practice. Disease activity was assessed using the BILAG-2004 and SLEDAI-2000 indices. The level of  agreement for items was used to assess the reliability of SLEDAI-2000. The ability to detect disease activity was assessed by determining the number of patients with a high activity on BILAG-2004 (overall score A or B) but low SLEDAI-2000 score (<6) and number of patients with low activity on BILAG-2004 (overall score C, D or E) but high SLEDAI-2000 score (>or=6). Treatment of these  patients was analysed, and the increase in treatment was used as the gold standard for active disease. RESULTS: 93 patients (90.3% women, 69.9% Caucasian)  were studied: mean age was 43.8 years, mean disease duration 10 years. There were 43 patients (46.2%) with a difference in SLEDAI-2000 score between the two raters and this difference was >or=4 in 19 patients (20.4%). Agreement for each of the items in SLEDAI-2000 was between 81.7 and 100%. 35 patients (37.6%) had high activity on BILAG-2004 but a low SLEDAI-2000 score, of which 48.6% had treatment  increased. There were only five patients (5.4%) with low activity on BILAG-2004 but a high SLEDAI-2000 score. CONCLUSIONS: SLEDAI-2000 is a reliable index to assess systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity but it is less able than the BILAG-2004 index to detect active disease requiring increased treatment.;2007-2009
164;Subclinical atherosclerosis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): the relative contribution of classic risk factors and the lupus phenotype.;2007;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Ahmad Y;"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the strength of association between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and carotid plaque development in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and controls. We also aimed to determine which lupus-related factors are associated with carotid plaque and whether SLE sensitizes patients to the effects of traditional factors. METHODS: We studied 200 women with SLE and 100 controls. Demographic and risk factor data were collected and SLE features, including autoantibody profiles and therapy were noted. All subjects had B- mode ultrasound of their carotid arteries examined for the presence and distribution of plaque. RESULTS: SLE patients <55 years old had  more plaque (21% vs 3% P < 0.01) and more SLE patients had plaque in the internal carotid artery (11% vs 4%; P < 0.05). Traditional risk factor models performed less well in SLE compared with controls [area under Receiver Operator Characteristic curves (AUC ROC) = 0.76 vs 0.90; P < 0.01]. A multivariable model  using SLE factors only, performed significantly better (AUC ROC = 0.87; P < 0.01). The final model in SLE included age and cigarette pack-years smoking as well as azathioprine exposure ever, antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) and previous arterial events (AUC ROC = 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: SLE patients have a higher prevalence and different distribution of carotid plaque than controls. SLE factors perform significantly better than traditional risk factors in their association with atherosclerosis in SLE and these factors add to the influence of traditional risk factors rather than sensitizing lupus patients to traditional factors. The SLE phenotype helps identify patients at increased risk of atherosclerosis.";2007-2009
165;Effects of short-term infliximab therapy on autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Arthritis and rheumatism;Aringer M;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze changes in autoantibodies occurring in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treated with 4 infusions of the chimeric anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) antibody infliximab. METHODS: In an open-label safety study, 7 patients with SLE were treated with infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 10 in combination with azathioprine or methotrexate. Antibodies to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were determined by radioimmunoassay and the Crithidia luciliae indirect immunofluorescence assay; anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and antibodies to histone and chromatin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antihistone antibodies were also analyzed by immunoblotting. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals and SLE patients were incubated for 2 weeks with or without TNFalpha. TNFalpha was removed by washing and by the addition of infliximab. Apoptotic cells were stained with annexin V and analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Autoantibodies to dsDNA increased in 5 of 7 patients. Histone, chromatin, and IgM aCL levels were increased in 4 of 7, 6 of 7, and 4 of 7 patients, respectively, peaking 4-10 weeks after the last infliximab infusion, but falling to baseline levels or lower thereafter. In the in vitro experiments, TNF withdrawal after long-term incubation with recombinant human TNF led to increased percentages of apoptotic cells. CONCLUSION: While TNF blockade was clinically effective, the majority of SLE patients treated with infliximab showed an increase in autoantibodies to nuclear antigens and phospholipids. These increases were transient and were not associated with disease flares. Increased availability of apoptotic antigens after TNF blockade may play a role in the autoantibody formation induced by TNF blockade.";2007-2009
166;Aspirin therapy and thromboxane biosynthesis in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Lupus;Avalos I;Incomplete suppression of thromboxane biosynthesis during aspirin therapy is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Since systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with platelet activation and increased cardiovascular mortality, we compared thromboxane and prostacyclin biosynthesis in patients with SLE and control subjects, and measured inhibition of thromboxane excretion in aspirin-treated subjects. We measured the urinary excretion of 11-dehydro thromboxane B( 2) (TXB(2)) and 2,3-dinor 6-ketoPGF(1alpha) (PGI-M), the stable metabolites of thromboxane A(2) and prostacyclin, respectively, in 74 patients with SLE and 70 controls. In subjects who were not receiving aspirin, TXB(2) excretion was higher in patients with SLE [0.40 ng/mg creatinine (0.26-0.64), median (interquartile range)] than controls [0.31 ng/mg creatinine (0.23-0.44)] (P = 0.04), and in these patients, TXB(2) excretion correlated with disease activity (rho = 0.28, P = 0.03) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (rho = 0.48, P <  0.001). Aspirin therapy resulted in significantly lower TXB(2) excretion in controls (P = 0.01), but not in patients with SLE (P = 0.10), compared with subjects not receiving aspirin. Prostacyclin biosynthesis did not differ among patients and controls, and was not affected by aspirin (P all >0.35). Thromboxane biosynthesis is increased in SLE and is associated with disease activity. Additionally, response to aspirin may be attenuated in some patients with SLE.;2007-2009
167;Systemic lupus erythematosus in a multiethnic US cohort (LUMINA) XL II: factors predictive of new or worsening proteinuria.;2007;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Bastian HM;"OBJECTIVES: To determine the factors predictive of new or worsening proteinuria in a large multiethnic cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Five hundred and twenty-nine SLE patients from a multiethnic US cohort [LUpus in MInorities: NAture versus Nurture (LUMINA)] were evaluated for new or worsening proteinuria using the categories of the Systemic Lupus Activity  Measure-Revised: (1), normal; (2), trace or 1+ proteinuria on the dipstick; (3),  2-3+ proteinuria and (4), > or =4+ proteinuria. A rise in urinary protein was considered a positive event visit. Basic demographic and socioeconomic variables  were assessed at baseline (T0). Clinical and immunological variables including disease features, activity, duration, comorbidities (such as hypertension and diabetes), medications and autoantibodies were assessed at the visit preceding a  positive event visit. Selected HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles, and FCGR receptor polymorphisms were assessed. Data were analysed using logistic regression analyses and generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: There were 243 patients (59.1% of 93 Texan Hispanics, 37.0% of 100 Puerto Rican Hispanics, 58.0% of 181 African Americans and 29.7% of 155 Caucasians) with new or worsening proteinuria, and 364 positive events in 2801 visits. Younger age [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.013, 95% confidence limits (CL) = 1.001-1.024, P < 0.0334], anti-dsDNA (OR = 1.554, CL = 1.149-2.100, P < 0.0042), and HLA-DRB1*1503 (OR = 1.746, 95% CL = 1.573-2.2673, P < 0.0103) were found to independently predict the occurrence of new or worsening  proteinuria. CONCLUSION: The factors predictive of new or worsening proteinuria include traditional factors associated with lupus nephritis, such as age and anti-dsDNA, as well as HLA-DRB1*1503, which has not been previously described in  association with lupus nephritis, new or worsening proteinuria.";2007-2009
168;Hodgkin's lymphoma in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Bernatsky S;"OBJECTIVE: In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), there is a well-documented increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), but little is known about the risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). The purpose of our work was to describe the phenomenon of HL in SLE. METHODS: A multi-site cohort of 9547 SLE subjects was assembled; HL cases were ascertained through cancer registry linkage, and the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for HL was determined. We also performed a literature search for HL cases in SLE, and compared these with our sample. Finally, we pooled results from our cohort study with two large population-based  cohort studies providing SIR estimates for HL in SLE. RESULTS: Five cases of HL occurred in our SLE cohort during the observation interval, for an SIR of 2.4 (95% CI 0.8, 5.5). The literature review documented 13 HL case reports developing in patients with SLE. A pooled analysis combining our data with the other large cohort studies yielded a standardized incidence ratio of 3.16 (95% CI, 1.63-5.51) for HL in SLE. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that risk in SLE is increased not only for NHL, but also for other malignancies arising from B-lymphocytes, including HL.";2007-2009
169;Systemic lupus erythematosus in a multiethnic US cohort LUMINA LI: anaemia as a predictor of disease activity and damage accrual.;2007;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Bertoli AM;OBJECTIVE: To examine if anaemia (and its severity) is associated with disease activity and damage accrual in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Four  thousand four-hundred study visits in 613 SLE patients enrolled in LUMINA were studied. Anaemia was expressed in four categories of haematocrit (Hct) as defined by the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure-Revised (SLAM-R): no anaemia (Hct >35%), mild (Hct = 30-35%), moderate (Hct = 25-29%) and severe (Hct <25%). Anti-dsDNA antibodies were measured at baseline. Disease activity was assessed with the SLAM-R and damage with the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Damage Index (SDI). The relationship between anaemia and anti-dsDNA antibodies with the SLAM and SDI scores was examined by univariate (one-way ANOVA) and multivariate (generalized linear models and generalized estimating equation regression) analyses. RESULTS: All categories of anaemia and anti-ds DNA were significantly associated with the SLAM-R at baseline and over time. However, only moderate and severe anaemia were associated with the SDI at baseline and over time, while the presence of anti-ds DNA was only associated with the SDI over time but not at baseline. Several clinical domains of the SLAM-R and SDI were associated with anaemia at baseline and over time. CONCLUSIONS: Mild, moderate and marked anaemia are strongly associated with disease activity in SLE. Moderate and marked anaemia are associated with damage accrual. These associations are observed both early and during the course of SLE. Different levels of anaemia could be used to monitor disease activity and predict organ/system damage in SLE.;2007-2009
170;Lung cancer in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands);Bin J;"BACKGROUND: Evidence points to a link between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and an increased risk of lung cancer. Our objective was to provide a brief report of the lung cancer cases from an SLE cohort, with respect to demographics, histology, and exposures to smoking and immunosuppressive medications. METHODS: Data were obtained from a multi-site international cohort study of over 9500 SLE  patients from 23 centres. Cancer cases were ascertained through linkage with regional tumor registries. RESULTS: We analyzed information on histology subtype  for 30 lung cancer cases that had occurred across five countries. Most (75%) of these 30 cases were female, with a median age of 61 (range 27-91) years. In eight cases, the histological type was not specified. In the remainder, the most common histological type reported was adenocarcinoma (N=8; two of the adenocarcinomas were bronchoalveolar carcinoma) followed by small cell carcinoma (N=6), and squamous cell carcinoma (N=6) with one case each of large cell carcinoma and carcinoid tumor. Most (71%) of the lung cancer cases were smokers; only the minority (20%) had been previously exposed to immunosuppressive agents. CONCLUSIONS: The histological distribution of the lung cancers from the SLE sample appeared similar to that of lung cancer patients in the general population, though the possibility of a higher proportion of more uncommon tumors (such as bronchoalveolar and carcinoid) cannot be excluded. A large proportion of the cancer cases were smokers, which is also not surprising. However, only a minority appeared to have been exposed to immunosuppressive agents. A large case-cohort study currently in progress should help shed light on the relative importance of these exposures in lung cancer risk for SLE patients.";2007-2009
171;Accrual of organ damage over time in Argentine patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a multi-centre study.;2007;Clinical rheumatology;Cassano G;The goals of this study were to ascertain damage in patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) from five rheumatologic centres in Argentina and to examine overall damage, damage by domain and damage by item within each domain. We performed a retrospective observational study including patients with SLE (ACR 1997 revised and modified criteria) from five rheumatology centres in Argentina.  Organ damage was scored using the SLICC/ACR DI (SDI), ascertained at years 1, 2,  5 and 10. Three centres provided information up to the fifth year. Of the 197 patients, 88.3% were women and their mean age was 33.2 years. The mean disease duration and follow-up were 7.6 and 5.3 years, respectively. Damage accrued gradually over time with SDI ranging from 0.52 (+/-1.1) at year 1 up to 2.46 (+/-2.1) at year 10. The renal system was the most involved system, followed by the neuropsychiatric, the cardiovascular and the musculoskeletal systems. Proteinuria, cognitive impairment, pericarditis, avascular necrosis, cataract and alopecia were the predominant items in their respective systems. Systems such as  peripheral vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, diabetes, malignancy and premature gonadal failure were not frequent. Overall SDI had a gradual increase over time. Damage in each domain of SDI, except for diabetes, had a similar behaviour. Behaviour of items in each domain varied.;2007-2009
172;The impact of increased body mass index on systemic lupus erythematosus: data from LUMINA, a multiethnic cohort (LUMINA XLVI) [corrected].;2007;Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic &;Chaiamnuay S;"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of an increased body mass index (BMI) on disease activity, damage accrual, fatigue, self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and fibromyalgia in patients with lupus using longitudinal data from LUMINA, a large multiethnic cohort. METHODS: SLE patients (>/=4 ACR revised criteria), </=5 years disease duration at entry into the cohort (T0), of Hispanic (from Texas or from the Island of Puerto Rico), African American, or white ethnicity were included. BMI was ascertained at T0 or  first recorded. The average scores from all visits for disease activity (SLAM-R), self-reported HRQOL (physical and mental component summary measures of the SF-36) and fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), the score at last visit for damage accrual  (SLICC Damage Index), and fibromyalgia (ACR criteria), if present at any visit, were examined for their association with an increased BMI by univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: Three-hundred sixty-four patients were included; 28% were obese (BMI >/=30 kg/m). An increased BMI was associated with older age,  less social support, higher degree of helplessness, depression, more abnormal illness-related behaviors, poorer self-reported HRQOL, fatigue, and fibromyalgia, but not with disease activity or damage accrual by univariable analyses. In multivariable analyses, BMI was independently associated with fibromyalgia but not with disease activity, fatigue, or self-reported HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: An increased BMI is independently associated with presence of fibromyalgia but not with disease activity, damage accrual, fatigue or self-reported quality of life in patients with SLE. Optimizing weight merits investigation to see if it can significantly impact this pervasive SLE-associated manifestation.";2007-2009
173;A pravastatin dose-escalation study in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Rheumatology international;Costenbader KH;Statin medications have been suggested for widespread use in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We studied the dose effectiveness and tolerability of pravastatin in SLE. We compared 41 SLE subjects in a two-month open-label dose-titration study of pravastatin to 22 SLE controls. Lipids, ALT, CPK, CRP, adverse effects were assessed. Linear mixed models assessed changes in  lipids and CRP, comparing pravastatin subjects to controls. After 1 month of pravastatin 10 mg a day, total cholesterol decreased by 16% (+/-12.1%) and LDL by 24% (+/-17%), compared with 1.8% (+/-7.5%) and 2.6% (+/-8.6%) decreases in controls (P < 0.001). CRP did not decline. Glucocorticoids appeared to decrease pravastatin effectiveness. Serum CPK increased in one subject. Pravastatin reduced LDL and total cholesterol levels approximately the same degree observed in normal individuals, but the effect appeared blunted in those on modest doses of glucocorticoids and those with higher BMI.;2007-2009
174;Association study of Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)  polymorphisms in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;The Journal of rheumatology;Demirci FY;OBJECTIVE: Toll-like receptors (TLR) play an important role in both adaptive and  innate immunity. Variations in TLR genes have been shown to be associated with various infectious and inflammatory diseases. We investigated the association of  TLR5 (Arg392Stop, rs5744168) and TLR9 (-1237T-->C, rs5743836) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Caucasian American subjects. METHODS: We performed a case-control association study and genotyped 409 Caucasian women with SLE and 509 Caucasian healthy female controls using TaqMan allelic discrimination (rs5744168) or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (rs5743836). RESULTS:  None of the 2 TLR SNP showed a statistically significant association with SLE risk in our cohort. CONCLUSION: Our results do not indicate a major influence of  these putative functional TLR SNP on the susceptibility to (or protection from) SLE.;2007-2009
175;Association of a common interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) variant with increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).;2007;Annals of human genetics;Demirci FY;"Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) belongs to a family of transcription factors that control the transactivation of type I interferon system-related genes, as well as the expression of several other genes involved in immune response, cell signalling, cell cycle control and apoptosis. Two recent studies reported a significant association between the IRF5/rs2004640 T allele and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the reported rs2004640 T allele association could be replicated in our independent SLE case-control sample. We genotyped DNA samples from 370 white SLE-affected female subjects and 462 white healthy female controls using the TaqMan Assay-on-Demand for rs2004640, and performed a case-control genetic association analysis. Frequency of the rs2004640 T allele was significantly higher in cases than in controls (56.5% vs. 50%; P= 0.008). The odds ratio for T  allele carriers was 1.68 (95% CI: 1.20 - 2.34; P= 0.003). Our results in an independent case-control sample confirm the robust association of the IRF5/rs2004640 T allele with SLE risk, and further support the relevance of the type I interferon system in the pathogenesis of SLE and autoimmunity.";2007-2009
176;Use of serum or buffer-changed EDTA-plasma in a rapid, inexpensive, and easy-to-perform hemolytic complement assay for differential diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus and monitoring of patients with the disease.;2007;Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI;Ekdahl KN;"We previously described a simplified quantitative hemolytic assay for classical pathway (CP) hemolytic function in serum that has been shown to correlate with the 50% hemolytic complement (CH50) assay. In the present study, we used this assay to compare CP functions; plasma levels of C3, C4, and C3dg; and ratios of C3dg to C3 in healthy individuals and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with different degrees of complement activation. A significant depression in CP function and levels of C4 and C3 and increased C3dg levels and C3dg/C3 ratios were observed in the SLE patients. In patients with RA, CP function was normal, whereas C3, C4, and C3dg levels and the C3dg/C3 ratio were elevated. The SLE results are compatible with systemic complement consumption, whereas the RA data suggest an acute-phase reaction with  a normal C3 catabolic rate. To facilitate the handling of patient samples, we also developed a method to restore the hemolytic function of EDTA-plasma by transferring it to Veronal-buffered saline containing the thrombin inhibitor lepirudin. This process inhibits coagulation and enables complement activation, allowing a longer time lag between sample harvesting and testing. These results,  combined with previous correlation studies, suggest that the CP hemolytic assay can effectively replace the CH50 assay for routine SLE differential diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity.";2007-2009
177;A multiethnic, multicenter cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as a model for the study of ethnic disparities in SLE.;2007;Arthritis and rheumatism;Fernandez M;"OBJECTIVE: To examine health disparities as a function of ethnicity using data from LUpus in MInorities, NAture versus nurture (LUMINA), a longitudinal study of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); to build an explanatory model of how ethnic disparities occur in this setting; and to suggest appropriate interventions. METHODS: LUMINA patients (meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE) ages >/=16 years of African American, Hispanic (from Texas), Hispanic (from Puerto Rico), or Caucasian ethnicity were studied. In addition to  examining the basic features of the cohort, we examined, by univariable and multivariable analyses, the factors associated with disease activity, damage accrual, lupus nephritis, and mortality. An empiric model based on the data presented (and the literature reviewed) was derived to explain the disparities observed. RESULTS: There were substantial differences in the socioeconomic/demographic, clinical, and genetic features among patients from the different ethnic groups, with Texan Hispanic and African American patients exhibiting overall a lower socioeconomic status, different genetic associations,  more serious disease at a younger age, and worse intermediate and final outcomes  than the Caucasian and Puerto Rican Hispanic patients. A model of disease outcome as a function of the disparities observed was created. CONCLUSION: Ethnic disparities occur in SLE. Environmental, socioeconomic/demographic, psychosocial, genetic, and clinical factors play an important role as determinants of the ethnic differences observed. Measures aimed at eliminating these disparities are  suggested while further research is conducted to elucidate the basis of these disparities and their changes at the societal level and to eliminate the gap between the rich and the poor.";2007-2009
178;Atorvastatin therapy improves endothelial-dependent vasodilation in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: an 8 weeks controlled trial.;2007;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Ferreira GA;INTRODUCTION: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have recognized reduction in endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Evidence demonstrates that statins are able to improve endothelial function independently on their hypolipemic action. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of atorvastatin in improving vasodilation in SLE patients with and without conventional risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four SLE women, mean age 31 +/- 8 yrs, received atorvastatin 20 mg/day during 8 weeks. Thirty-one patients in this intervention group did not have conventional risk factors for CHD, while 33 others had hypertension, dyslipidaemia and/or obesity. Twenty-four  SLE control patients, mean age 34 +/- 7.5 yrs, not receiving atorvastatin were followed during the same time period. High-resolution ultrasound was used to measure brachial artery diameter in resting conditions, during reactive hyperaemia and after sub-lingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Measurements were performed at baseline and at the end of the study (8 weeks). RESULTS: Atorvastatin was associated with a significant increase in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) [3.8 (2.8-7.9%) vs 6.9 (4.2-10.7%), P < 0.001] while GTN-mediated dilation  (GTND) was unaffected [20.9 (16.6-26.1%) vs 20.1(16.6-25.4%), P = 0.514]. FMD increase was observed in patients with conventional risk factors [4.1 (3.1-8.7%)  vs 6.5 (4-10%), P = 0.046] and also for those without conventional risk factors for CHD [3.6 (2.6-7.3%) vs 7.1 (4.5-10.9%), P = 0.001]. Resting brachial artery diameter also increased significantly in patients receiving atorvastatin (2.79 +/- 0.30 mm vs 2.92 +/- 0.40 mm, P < 0.001). No significant difference in artery  diameter and FMD was seen in control patients at the end of the study. When compared to the control patients, atorvastatin treatment was associated with significant increase in resting diameter (+0.13 +/- 0.1 mm vs -0.02 +/- 0.07 mm,  P < 0.001) and FMD (+1.9 +/- 3.9% vs -0.3 +/- 1.8%, P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that an 8-week 20 mg/day atorvastatin series improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in SLE patients independently on the presence  of conventional risk factors for atherosclerotic disease.

Here, we explore the effect of different combinations of Class II risk haplotypes in a large, multi-center collection of 780 SLE families. Haplotypes bearing the DRB1*1501/DQB1*0602 (DR2)  and DRB1*0301/DQB1*0201 (DR3) alleles were present in nearly two-thirds of SLE cases and were significantly associated with disease susceptibility in both family-based and case-control study designs. DR3-containing haplotypes conferred  higher risk for disease than DR2, and individual homozygous for DR3 or compound heterozygous for DR3 and DR2 showed the highest risk profile. DR2 haplotypes were also found to be associated with antibodies to the nuclear antigen Sm, and, as previously observed, DR3 genotypes were associated with Ro and La autoantibodies. Interestingly, SLE cases and unaffected family members who were DR2/DR3 compound  heterozygotes showed particularly strong risk of developing antibodies to Ro, and were enriched for La and Sm. These data provide convincing evidence that particular combinations of HLA Class II DR2 and DR3 haplotypes are key determinants of autoantibody production and disease susceptibility in human SLE.;2007-2009
180;Neuropsychiatric events at the time of diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus: an international inception cohort study.;2007;Arthritis and rheumatism;Hanly JG;OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence, characteristics, attribution, and clinical significance of neuropsychiatric (NP) events in an international inception cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. METHODS: The study was conducted  by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC). Patients were  enrolled within 15 months of fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) SLE classification criteria. All NP events within a predefined enrollment window were identified using the ACR case definitions of 19 NP syndromes. Decision rules were derived to determine the proportion of NP disease attributable to SLE. Clinical significance was determined using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey and the SLICC/ACR Damage Index (SDI). RESULTS: A total of 572 patients (88% female) were recruited, with a mean +/- SD age of 35 +/- 14 years. The mean +/- SD disease duration was 5.2 +/- 4.2 months. Within the enrollment window, 158 of 572 patients (28%) had at least 1 NP event. In total, there were 242 NP events that encompassed 15 of 19 NP syndromes. The proportion of NP events attributed to SLE varied from 19% to 38% using alternate attribution models and occurred in 6.1-11.7% of patients. Those with NP events, regardless of attribution, had lower scores on the SF-36 and higher SDI scores compared with patients with no NP events. CONCLUSION: Twenty-eight percent of SLE patients experienced at least 1 NP event around the time of diagnosis of SLE, of which only a minority were attributed to SLE. Regardless of attribution, the occurrence of NP events was associated with reduced quality of life and increased organ damage.;2007-2009
181;A functional M196R polymorphism of tumour necrosis factor receptor type 2 is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus: a case-control study and a meta-analysis.;2007;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Horiuchi T;"OBJECTIVES: To perform a case-control study of a functional M196R polymorphism of tumour necrosis factor receptor type 2 (TNF-RII) in a Japanese population and a meta-analysis of all published reports on the polymorphism to investigate the association of the M196R polymorphism of TNF-RII with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: The functional M196R polymorphism of TNF-RII was genotyped by using polymerase chain reaction combined with the subsequent single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis for screening, followed by nucleotide sequencing for confirmation. A total of 331 patients and 359 controls were subjected to a case-control study. A meta-analysis of the available case-control studies including all published data as well as our own data was performed to investigate the association of the functional M196R polymorphism of TNF-RII with SLE. RESULTS: Our case-control study did not show any significant association of a functional M196R polymorphism of TNF-RII with SLE, although there was a trend towards association. A meta-analysis of seven case-control studies in eight different ethnic populations including our own showed that 196M/R and 196R/R genotypes combined was significantly associated with an increased risk of SLE (odds ratio (OR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.60; p = 0.02). Stratification by ethnicity showed a more significant association in Asians, including Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.78; p = 0.006). The effect of the 196R allele on SLE was not clear in Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: The 196R allele of the functional M196R polymorphism of  TNF-RII is a risk factor for SLE, especially in the Asian population.";2007-2009
182;Reduced B lymphocyte and immunoglobulin levels after atacicept treatment in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: results of a multicenter, phase Ib, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating trial.;2007;Arthritis and rheumatism;Dall'Era M;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and tolerability of atacicept in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the biologic effect of atacicept on B lymphocyte and immunoglobulin levels. Atacicept is a TACI-Ig fusion protein that  inhibits B cell stimulation by binding to B lymphocyte stimulator and a proliferation-inducing ligand. METHODS: This phase Ib, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating trial comprised 6 cohorts of patients treated with atacicept or placebo in a 3:1 ratio of active drug to placebo (n = 8 per group; n = 7 in cohort 5). Cohorts 1-4 received a single subcutaneous dose of placebo or either 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 9 mg/kg of atacicept. Cohorts 5 and 6 received weekly doses of placebo or either 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg of atacicept  for 4 weeks. Patients were followed up for 6 weeks (cohorts 1-4) or 9 weeks (cohorts 5 and 6). Patients with mild-to-moderate SLE were enrolled. RESULTS: Biologic activity of atacicept was demonstrated by dose-dependent reductions in immunoglobulin levels and in mature and total B cell numbers. This effect was most pronounced in the repeated-dose cohorts and was sustained throughout the followup period. There were no changes in the numbers of T cells, natural killer  cells, or monocytes. Mild injection-site reactions occurred more frequently among the atacicept group than the placebo group. There were no differences in the frequency or type of adverse events and no severe or serious adverse events in patients treated with atacicept. CONCLUSION: Atacicept administered subcutaneously was well tolerated and demonstrated biologic activity consistent with the proposed mechanism of action. ";2007-2009
183;Association between early onset and organ manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a down-regulating promoter polymorphism in the MBL2 gene.;2007;Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.);Jakab L;The serum concentration of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is genetically determined by a series of allelic polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene. Since several polymorphisms of the MBL2 gene have been suggested to be risk locus for systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE), we investigated MBL2 polymorphisms in 315 SLE patients from Hungary and 182 geographically matched healthy controls. Within the group of patients, we found that homozygotes for an MBL2 down-regulating promoter polymorphism at position -221 (YA to XA) (rs7096206) were significantly (p=0.017) younger at diagnosis than the other patients. The frequency of juvenile-onset SLE (<or=20 years) was particularly high among XA/XA homozygotes (17.4%) as compared  to the rest of the patients (5.6%) (p=0.004). XA/XA carriers did have significantly higher risk of development of cutaneous manifestations (p=0.003) and pleuritis/pericarditis (p=0.013) as compared with the rest of the patients. These data indicate that MBL may act as a disease modifier in SLE patients through a mechanism to be identified.;2007-2009
184;Bromocriptine during pregnancy in systemic lupus erythematosus: a pilot clinical  trial.;2007;Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences;Jara LJ;"Bromocriptine (BRC) prevents postpartum flare in lupus patients. However, its potential role in protecting lupus pregnancy from maternal-fetal complications has not been studied. The objective of the study was to explore the role of oral  BRC during pregnancy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Pregnant SLE patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 received BRC 2.5 mg/day and prednisone 10 mg/day; group 2 received prednisone 10 mg/day. These treatments were administered from 25 to 35 weeks of gestation. Prolactin (PRL) levels were determined at 25, 30, and 35 weeks. The SLE Pregnancy Disease Activity Index, maternal-fetal outcome including preterm birth, fetal loss, premature rupture of membrane (PRM), low birth weight, and preeclampsia/eclampsia were evaluated. We studied 20 patients (10 in each group). A significant decrease of PRL levels in group 1 compared to group 2 at week 30 and at week 35 was found. No patients in the BRC group had flares and three from group 2 had SLE activity.  None of the patients in group 1 had PRM but three patients in group 2 did. Eighty percent of pregnancies ended in birth at term in group 1 and 50% in group 2. There was no fetal loss in both groups. Mean birth weight was higher in group 1 than in group 2 (P < NS). BRC was well tolerated. This is the first clinical trial of BRC in SLE pregnancy. Our pilot study suggests that BRC may play a role  in the prevention of maternal-fetal complications, such as PRM, preterm birth, and active disease.";2007-2009
185;Effect of glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms and proximity to hazardous waste sites on time to systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis: results from the Roxbury lupus project.;2007;Arthritis and rheumatism;Karlson EW;OBJECTIVE: The high prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) among African American women may be due to environmental exposures, genetic factors, or a combination of factors. Our goal was to assess association of residential proximity to hazardous waste sites and genetic variation in 3 glutathione Stransferase (GST) genes (GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1) with age at diagnosis of SLE.  METHODS: Residential histories were obtained by interviewing 93 SLE patients from 3 predominantly African American neighborhoods in Boston. Residential addresses and locations of 416 hazardous waste sites in the study area were geocoded using  ArcView software. Time-varying Cox models were used to study the effect of residential proximity to hazardous sites, GST genotype, and interaction between genotype and exposure in determining age at diagnosis. RESULTS: The prevalence of SLE among African American women in these neighborhoods was 3.56 SLE cases per 1,000. Homozygosity for GSTM1-null and GSTP1 Ile105Val in combination was associated with earlier SLE diagnosis (P = 0.03), but there was no association with proximity to 416 hazardous sites. Available data on specific site contaminants suggested that, at a subset of 67 sites, there was higher potential  risk for exposure to volatile organic compounds (P < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction). GST genotypes had a significant interaction with proximity (P = 0.03) in analyses limited to these sites. CONCLUSION: There was no independent association between residential proximity to hazardous waste sites and the risk of earlier SLE diagnosis in this urban population. However, analysis of a limited number of sites indicated that the risk of earlier SLE associated with proximity  to hazardous sites might be modulated by GST polymorphisms.;2007-2009
186;Role of APRIL (TNFSF13) polymorphisms in the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus in Japanese.;2007;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Kawasaki A;"OBJECTIVES: A polymorphism of APRIL, c.199G > A (Gly67Arg), has been reported to  be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Japanese. To identify the causative polymorphism, we screened for polymorphisms of APRIL as well as TWEAK (TNFSF12), a closely located gene that generates a fusion protein TWE-PRIL  by intergenic splicing. Association of APRIL and TWEAK with rheumatoid arthritis  (RA) was examined in parallel. METHODS: Polymorphisms were screened by direct sequencing. Association was analysed by case-control analysis using 266 SLE, 298  RA and 208 healthy individuals. Allele-specific difference in the mRNA level was  examined using RNA difference plot analysis. Serum APRIL level was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The protective effect of APRIL c.199A/A homozygotes in SLE was replicated (odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.30-0.83, P = 0.0073; pooled P = 0.0001, Pcorr = 0.007). In addition, association of c.287A > G (Asn96Ser, P = 0.0064, allele frequency) and c.*263C > T (3' untranslated region, P = 0.025, allele frequency) was detected. c.199G-c.287A (67Gly-96Asn) haplotype  was found to confer risk for SLE, while c.199A-c.287G (67Arg-96Ser) was protective. Association of TWEAK was observed neither for SLE nor RA. APRIL mRNA  was increased in SLE-associated c.*263T allele. In addition, serum APRIL was undetectable in all six healthy controls homozygous for the protective c.199A-c.287G haplotype (P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to replicating the  protective role of APRIL c.199A/A, two additional SNPs in APRIL were found to be  associated with SLE. Presence of a protective haplotype and a risk haplotype was  demonstrated. The mechanism of association was suggested to be altered expression at the protein and mRNA levels.";2007-2009
187;Characteristics of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).;2007;Clinical rheumatology;King JK;"Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), but features of SLE associated with NHL  are not well described. The objective of this study was to describe SLE characteristics, laboratory serologies, and medication histories in patients who  subsequently develop NHL. Two thousand twenty patients with SLE were identified using the online Partners' patient database research tool between October 1992 and June 2005. We confirmed the diagnoses of SLE and NHL and sought details of medical history and treatment by medical record review. Eleven patients with NHL  without coexisting rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's, or HIV were identified; seven of these (64%) had a diffuse large B cell lymphoma subtype, and 83% of those stained were Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) negative. The mean duration of SLE at NHL diagnosis was 17.8 years (range 1.6-41.8), and the mean Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics/American College of Rheumatology damage index was 1.9. Seven patients (64%) had SLE hematologic involvement, four had anti-dsDNA antibodies, and four had anti-phospholipid antibodies. One patient had significant renal disease. All patients had arthritis and had received antimalarial therapy. Five of 11 patients had received other treatments for SLE,  including cyclophosphamide, imuran, methotrexate, and/or sulfasalazine. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma was the most common subtype of NHL, and most were EBV negative. Although disease duration was fairly long and end organ damage moderately severe in this group of patients, renal disease and the use of immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic agents were rare and did not appear to confer  an increased risk of NHL development.";2007-2009
188;Structural insertion/deletion variation in IRF5 is associated with a risk haplotype and defines the precise IRF5 isoforms expressed in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Arthritis and rheumatism;Kozyrev SV;OBJECTIVE: To determine whether specific isoforms of IRF5 are transcribed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who have risk genotypes in the exon 1B donor splice site at single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) no. rs2004640.  METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from SLE patients and healthy controls from Argentina, Spain, and Germany and from trio families from Spain and Denmark. A reporter assay was used to investigate the role of SNP no. rs2004640. IRF5 expression in relation to the genotypes of functional SNPs was analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Sequencing and genotyping  of the IRF5 gene was performed. RESULTS: Sequencing of complementary DNA from individuals with different genotypes showed 4 basic isoforms transcribed from all 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTRs), suggesting no preferential isoform transcription based on rs2004640 genotypes. Analysis of translation efficiency showed that exon 1A was the most efficient in initiating protein synthesis. We identified a novel polymorphic insertion/deletion that defines the pattern of expression of isoforms of IRF5. The insertion consists of 4 repeats in exon 6 affecting the protein interaction domain. The insertion segregates in the risk haplotype with the high expression allele of a poly(A) site SNP no. rs10954213 and the exon 1B donor splice allele of the 5'-UTR SNP no. rs2004640. The poly(A)  polymorphism correlated with levels of IRF5 in cells stimulated with interferon-alpha. The SNP most strongly associated with SLE was SNP no. rs2070197 (P=5.2x10(-11)), which is a proxy of the risk haplotype, but does not appear to be functional. CONCLUSION: None of the functional variants investigated in this study is strongly associated with SLE, with the exception of the exon 1B donor splice site, and its functional importance appears to be small. Our results suggest that there may be other functional polymorphisms, yet to be identified, in IRF5. We did not observe evidence of epistatic interaction between the functional SNPs.;2007-2009
189;Safety and efficacy of hepatitis B vaccine in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Lupus;Kuruma KA;"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination has been implicated as a potential trigger for autoimmune diseases but there are no prospective studies in lupus. We therefore assessed prospectively the safety and efficacy of immunization with recombinant DNA HBV vaccine (Euvax B; LG Life Sciences) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Twenty-eight consecutive inactive SLE patients [Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) <4], age between 18 and 50 years and negative serology for HBV, were selected. Exclusion criteria were prednisone >/=20 mg/day and immunosuppressive drugs. Clinical and laboratorial assessments were obtained at study entry and one month after the three doses. In addition, a previous one year evaluation was performed using a standard electronic protocol. The mean age was 34 +/- 7.7 years and disease duration was 10.4 +/- 6.7 years. An adequate seroconversion was achieved at the end of the study (93%), although a lower frequency after the first (4%) and second dose (54%) was observed. No significant change in mean SLEDAI score was detected after each dose throughout the study (0.14 +/- 0.52 versus 0 versus 0.61 +/- 1.66 versus 0.36 +/- 1.34, P = 0.11). Reinforcing these findings, the 11% flares during vaccination was similar to the 21% observed in the previous year (P = 0.46). Furthermore, the mean prednisone dose at study entry was comparable to the end of the study (2.86 +/- 3.06 versus 4.64 +/- 8.25 mg/day, P = 0.32). In addition, the frequency of immunosuppressive therapy during the vaccination period (11%) was alike to the 14% observed in the previous year before entry (P = 0.66). Hepatitis B vaccination was safe in inactive SLE patients with an adequate vaccine response rate.";2007-2009
190;APRIL polymorphism and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility.;2007;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Lee YH;OBJECTIVE: Two novel non-synonymous polymorphisms of the APRIL gene, codon 67 (rs11552708) and 96 (rs3803800), were recently identified and tested for disease  association. The 67G allele was reported to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Japanese population. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the APRIL polymorphism associated with susceptibility to SLE  in a Japanese population is associated with the susceptibility to SLE in other ethnic groups. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-eight SLE patients (204 European-American, 103 African-American and 41 Hispanic) and 345 ethnicity-matched controls (201 European-American, 104 African-American and 40 Hispanic) were included from the Lupus Multiplex Registry and Repository (LMRR) and evaluated for genetic association. The APRIL codon 67 and codon 96 were genotyped by a 3-base extension method. Statistical evaluations were performed using both chi-square and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Both the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in cases and controls within each ethnic group. The APRIL codon 67 was significantly associated with SLE risk under the dominant model adjusted by ethnicity (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval and P-values were 1.45 and 1.02-2.06 and 0.036, respectively). Race-specific analysis also showed a trend for association in African-American and Hispanic SLE subjects. CONCLUSION The APRIL codon G67R polymorphism associated with SLE in a Japanese population may also be associated  with SLE in other populations.;2007-2009
191;Bosentan use in systemic lupus erythematosus patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.;2007;Lupus;Mok MY;Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is uncommon but is associated with poor survival. This study  aimed to examine the long-term effects of bosentan, a dual endothelin-1 receptor  antagonist, on symptomatology, haemodynamics and quality of life measures in SLE  patients with symptomatic PAH. Four local patients had been followed up prospectively with pre-defined protocol during 12-months of bosentan treatment. Six minute walk distance (6MWD), NYHA functional class, Borg Dyspnoea Index (BDI) and SF-36 were measured at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Systolic pulmonary arterial  pressure (PAP) was measured by transthoracic echocardiography at zero, six and 12 months. Clinical parameters were analysed, pooling data from other SLE patients reported in the literature (n = 4). Bosentan was found to result in significant improvement in 6MWD compared to baseline [+24.8 m, +26.2 m, +54 m and +62.7 m at  three (P = 0.001), six (P = 0.001), nine (P = 0.24) and 12 (P = 0.01) months respectively]. A differential effect was found with greater response in patients  with lower exercise capacity. This was accompanied by decrease in NYHA functional class, BDI, transient or sustained drop in systolic PAP and mild improvement in SF-36 domains including mental health, vitality, social function and general health. Significantly deranged liver function was found in one patient.;2007-2009
192;Activation signal transduction by beta1 integrin in T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Arthritis and rheumatism;Nakayamada S;OBJECTIVE: Beta 1 integrin is a representative adhesion molecule for cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, and it provides costimulatory signals to T cells. However, the relevance of beta1 integrin to T cell activation in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains unclear. We undertook this study to perform a quantitative and functional analysis of beta1 integrin-mediated signaling to T cells in patients with SLE. METHODS: Expression of cell surface molecules was assessed by flow cytometric analysis. Engagement of beta1 integrins was performed by crosslinking using a specific monoclonal antibody. To assess tyrosine kinases in beta1 integrin-mediated signaling, the cells were transfected with a wild-type (WT) focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a dominant-negative truncation of the FAK, or a WT PTEN expression plasmid via nucleofection. RESULTS: Beta 1 integrin expression was significantly up-regulated on peripheral blood T cells from patients with active SLE, particularly those with the complication of World  Health Organization class IV nephritis, whereas CD28 was significantly decreased  in patients with active SLE compared with normal individuals. Beta 1 integrin expression closely correlated with serum hypocomplementemia. Engagement of beta1  integrin on T cells from patients with active SLE, but not on those from normal individuals, induced cell proliferation as well as CD40L expression on T cells. Up-regulation of CD40L expression and T cell proliferation, induced by beta1 integrin stimulation, were completely inhibited by transfection of the dominant-negative truncations of FAK or WT PTEN. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that engagement of beta1 integrins on SLE T cells could induce FAK-mediated signaling and subsequent CD40L expression and proliferation. Thus, the beta1 integrin signaling cascade might serve to enhance autoreactive T cell activation.;2007-2009
193;The systemic lupus erythematosus Tri-Nation study: cumulative indirect costs.;2007;Arthritis and rheumatism;Panopalis P;OBJECTIVE: We previously reported that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the US incurred approximately 19% and 12% higher direct medical costs than patients in Canada and the UK, respectively, without experiencing superior outcomes expressed as disease damage or quality of life. In the present study, we compared cumulative indirect costs over 4 years in these patients. METHODS: A total of 715 patients with SLE (269 US, 231 Canada, 215 UK) were surveyed semiannually for 4 years on employment status and time lost from labor and nonlabor market activities. Cross-country comparisons of indirect costs were performed. RESULTS: In the US, Canada, and the UK, mean 4-year cumulative indirect costs (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) due to diminished labor market  activity were $56,745 ($49,919, $63,571), $38,642 ($32,785, $44,500), and $42,213 ($35,859, $48,567), respectively, and cumulative indirect costs due to diminished nonlabor market activity were $5,249 ($2,766, $7,732), $5,455 ($3,290, $7,620), and $8,572 ($5,626, $11,518), respectively. Regression results showed that cumulative indirect costs (95% CI) due to diminished labor market activity in the US were $6,750 ($580, $12,910) greater than in Canada and $10,430 ($4,050, $16,800) greater than in the UK. Indirect costs due to diminished nonlabor market activity in the US were $280 (-$2,950, $3,520) less than in Canada and $2,010 (-$1,490, $5,510) less than in the UK, both results insignificant due to wide CIs. CONCLUSION: Despite American patients incurring greater direct medical costs than Canadian and British patients, they do not experience superior health outcomes in terms of less productivity loss in either labor market or nonlabor market activities.

194;Association of a CD24 gene polymorphism with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Arthritis and rheumatism;Sanchez E;OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential role of the CD24 A57V gene polymorphism in  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: We studied 3 cohorts of Caucasian patients and controls. The Spanish cohort included 696 SLE patients and 539 controls, the German cohort included 257 SLE patients and 317 controls, and the Swedish cohort included 310 SLE patients and 247 controls. The CD24 A57V polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction, using a predeveloped TaqMan allele discrimination assay. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: In the Spanish cohort there was a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the CD24 V allele between SLE patients and controls (OR 3.6 [95% CI 2.13-6.16], P < 0.0001). In addition, frequency of the CD24 V/V genotype was increased in SLE patients compared with controls (OR 3.7 [95% CI 2.16-6.34], P < 0.00001). We sought to replicate this association with SLE in a German population and a Swedish population. A similar trend was found in the German group. The CD24 V/V genotype  and the CD24 V allele were more frequent in SLE patients than in controls, although this difference was not statistically significant. No differences were observed in the Swedish group. A meta-analysis of the Spanish and German cohorts  demonstrated that the CD24 V allele has a risk effect in SLE patients (pooled OR  1.25 [95% CI 1.08-1.46], P = 0.003). In addition, homozygosity for the CD24 V risk allele significantly increased the effect (pooled OR 2.19 [95% CI 1.50-3.22], P = 0.00007). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the CD24 A57V polymorphism plays a role in susceptibility to SLE in a Spanish population.

195;Menopause hormonal therapy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Arthritis and rheumatism;Sanchez-Guerrero J;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of menopause hormonal therapy on disease activity in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: We conducted  a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 106 women with SLE who were in the menopausal transition or in early or late postmenopause. Patients received a continuous-sequential estrogen-progestogen regimen (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54). Disease activity was assessed at baseline and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18,  21, and 24 months, according to the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). The primary outcome measure was global disease activity, estimated by measuring the area under the SLEDAI curve. Secondary outcome measures included maximum SLEDAI score, change in SLEDAI score, incidence of lupus flares, median time to flare, medication use, and adverse events. Results were studied using intent-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: At baseline, demographic and disease characteristics were similar in both groups. Mean +/- SD SLEDAI scores were 3.5 +/- 3.3 and 3.1 +/- 3.4 in the menopause hormonal therapy and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.57). Disease activity remained mild and stable in both groups throughout the trial. There were no significant differences between the groups in global or maximum disease activity, incidence or probability of flares, or medication use.  Median time to flare was 3 months in both groups. Thromboses occurred in 3 patients who received menopause hormonal therapy and in 1 patient who received placebo. One patient in each group died during the trial due to sepsis. CONCLUSION: Menopause hormonal therapy did not alter disease activity during 2 years of treatment. However, an apparently increased risk of thrombosis seems to  be a real threat in women with SLE who receive menopausal hormone therapy.;2007-2009

Amenorrhea was observed in 35 patients (11.7%) with a mean duration of 7.2 +/- 3.6 months. The hormones were performed in 32/35 patients and none of them had FSH and LH levels above and estradiol below the normal range according to pubertal changes. JSLE patients with amenorrhea were younger (15.04 +/- 2.5 versus 17.8 +/- 3.1 years; P = 0.001), and had a shorter period of time between menarche and current age (3.4 +/- 2.9 versus 6.7 +/- 5.4 years; P = 0.001). Interestingly, the frequency, cumulative dose, number of pulses and duration of intravenous cyclophosphamide treatment were alike in patients with and without amenorrhea (P > 0.05). In contrast, patients with amenorrhea had significantly higher SLEDAI (P = 0.01) and SLICC/ACR-DI (P = 0.024) scores compared to those without this condition. Independent risk factors identified by multivariate analysis were higher SLEDAI (OR = 1.059; CI = 1.004-1.116; P = 0.034) and SLICC/ACR-DI (OR = 2.125; IC = 1.373-3.291; P = 0.001) scores. Our data suggest that in spite of immunosuppressive therapy, JSLE patients have an adequate ovarian follicular reserve and amenorrhea is particularly associated with disease activity and damage.";2007-2009
197;The efficacy of vitamin E against oxidative damage and autoantibody production in systemic lupus erythematosus: a preliminary study.;2007;Clinical rheumatology;Maeshima E;"The hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS) modification of DNA is involved in the development of autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is supported by the enhanced reactivity of anti-DNA antibodies to ROS-denatured DNA. We studied the efficacy of vitamin E against both oxidative DNA damage and autoantibody production in SLE. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an indicator of oxidative DNA damage, and the anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-ds DNA) antibody, a predictor of disease activity, were assayed twice, first during the season with the most intense sunlight and then later in the year. Twelve women among 36 outpatients received vitamin E (150 to 300 mg/day) together with prednisolone (PSL). No significant age or daily dose of PSL differences were evident between patient groups. Urinary 8-OHdG in the PSL with vitamin E group (15.0 +/- 10.2 ng/mg during the period of intense sunlight and 11.7 +/- 8.7 ng/mg during the remainder of the year) did not differ significantly from that in the PSL without vitamin E group (20.0 +/- 23.2 and 11.0 +/- 5.9 ng/mg, at these respective times), but the anti-ds DNA antibody titer in the PSL with vitamin E group (17.9 +/- 20.3 IU/l during the period of intense sunlight and 16.3 +/- 19.4 IU/l during the remainder of the year) was significantly lower than that in the PSL without vitamin E group for both sunlight-defined periods (66.3 +/- 76.8 and  55.8 +/- 59.0 IU/l, at these respective times; P < 0.05). The present study suggests that vitamin E can suppress autoantibody production via a mechanism independent of antioxidant activity. ";2007-2009
198;Expression profile of FcgammaRIIb on leukocytes and its dysregulation in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950);Su K;FcgammaRIIb (CD32B, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 604590), an IgG FcR with  a tyrosine-based inhibitory motif, plays a critical role in the balance of tolerance and autoimmunity in murine models. However, the high degree of homology between FcgammaRIIb and FcgammaRIIa in humans and the lack of specific Abs to differentiate them have hampered study of the normal expression profile of FcgammaRIIb and its potential dysregulation in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Using our newly developed anti-FcgammaRIIb mAb 4F5 which does not react with FcgammaRIIa, we found that FcgammaRIIb is expressed on the cell surface of circulating B lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), and at very low levels on plasmacytoid DCs from some donors. Normal donors with the less frequent 2B.4 promoter haplotype have higher FcgammaRIIb expression on monocytes, neutrophils,  and myeloid DCs similar to that reported for B lymphocytes, indicating that FcgammaRIIb expression on both myeloid and lymphoid cells is regulated by the naturally occurring regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms in the FCGR2B promoter. FcgammaRIIb expression in normal controls is up-regulated on memory B lymphocytes compared with naive B lymphocytes. In contrast, in active SLE, FcgammaRIIb is significantly down-regulated on both memory and plasma B lymphocytes compared with naive and memory/plasma B lymphocytes from normals. Similar down-regulation of FcgammaRIIb on myeloid-lineage cells in SLE was not seen. Our studies demonstrate the constitutive regulation of FcgammaRIIb by natural gene polymorphisms and the acquired dysregulation in SLE autoimmunity, which may identify opportunities for using this receptor as a therapeutic target.;2007-2009
199;A multicenter phase I/II trial of rituximab for refractory systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Modern rheumatology / the Japan Rheumatism Association;Tanaka Y;Although corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are widely used for the treatments of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), safer and more effective therapies are prerequisite. We and others have reported that anti-CD20 antibody rituximab targeting B cells are effective for refractory SLE and, therefore, safety and clinical efficacy of rituximab in SLE was evaluated by a multicenter phase I/II clinical trial. An open-label, multicenter study of 15 patients with active and refractory SLE (total British Isles Lupus Assessment Group [BILAG] score 8 to 17) was conducted. Rituximab was administered to 5 SLE patients as 4 infusions of 500 mg/body every week and to 10 SLE patients as 2 infusions of 1000 mg/body every other week. Assessment of safety, infusion reactions and adverse effects was used as the primary outcome for clinical tolerability and was evaluated by 28 weeks. Rituximab was well tolerated, with most experiencing no significant adverse effects. B cells rapidly reduced in all patients and remained low until 6 months post-treatment. Four patients developed human antichimeric antibodies without affecting efficacy of rituximab. Changes in routine safety laboratory tests clearly related to rituximab were not observed. Nine among 14 evaluable patients achieved the major or partial clinical response of BILAG score and prednisolone dose significantly decreased at the 28 weeks. Rituximab therapy  appears to be safe for the treatment of active SLE patients and holds significant therapeutic promise, at least for the majority of patients experiencing profound  B-cell depletion.;2007-2009
200;Efficacy of rituximab (anti-CD20) for refractory systemic lupus erythematosus involving the central nervous system.;2007;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Tokunaga M;AIM: Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is a serious treatment-resistant phenotype of systemic lupus erythematosus. A standard treatment for NPSLE is not available. This report describes the clinical and laboratory tests of 10 patients with NPSLE before and after rituximab treatment,  including changes in lymphocyte phenotypes. METHODS: Rituximab was administered at different doses in 10 patients with refractory NPSLE, despite intensive treatment. RESULTS: Treatment with rituximab resulted in rapid improvement of central nervous system-related manifestations, particularly acute confusional state. Rituximab also improved cognitive dysfunction, psychosis and seizure, and  reduced the SLE Disease Activity Index Score at day 28 in all 10 patients. These  effects lasted for >1 year in five patients. Flow cytometric analysis showed that rituximab down regulated CD40 and CD80 on B cells and CD40L, CD69 and inducible costimulator on CD4+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab rapidly improved refractory  NPSLE, as evident by resolution of various clinical signs and symptoms and improvement of radiographic findings. The down regulation of functional molecules on B and T cells suggests that rituximab modulates the interaction of activated B and T cells through costimulatory molecules. These results warrant further analysis of rituximab as treatment for NPSLE.;2007-2009
201;Clinical manifestations and coronary artery disease risk factors at diagnosis of  systemic lupus erythematosus: data from an international inception cohort.;2007;Lupus;Urowitz MB;Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) comprises 27 centres from 11 countries. An inception cohort of 918 SLE patients has been assembled according to a standardized protocol between 2000 and 2006. Clinical features, classic coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors, as well as other potential risk factors were collected. Of the 918 patients 89% were females, and of multi racial origin. Less than half the patients were living in a permanent relationship, 58% had post secondary education and 51% were employed. Eight percent had family history of SLE. At enrolment, with at mean age of diagnosis of 34.5 years, a significant number of patients already had CAD risk factors, such as hypertension (33%) and hypercholesterolemia (36%). Only 15% of the patients were postmenopausal, 16% were current smokers and 3.6% had diabetes at entry to the SLICC-RAS (Registry for Atherosclerosis). A number of patients in this multi-racial, multi-ethnic inception cohort of lupus patients have classic CAD risk factors within a mean of 5.4 months from diagnosis. This cohort will be increased to 1500 patients to be followed yearly for 10 years. This will provide  a unique opportunity to evaluate risk factors for accelerated atherosclerosis in  SLE.;2007-2009
202;Deficient CD4+CD25high T regulatory cell function in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950);Valencia X;CD4(+)CD25(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs) play an essential role in maintaining immunologic homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by a loss of tolerance to nuclear components. We hypothesized that altered function of CD4(+)CD25(high) Tregs might play a role in the breakdown of immunologic self-tolerance in patients with SLE. In this study, we report a significant decrease in the suppressive function of CD4(+)CD25(high) Tregs from peripheral blood of patients  with active SLE as compared with normal donors and patients with inactive SLE. Notably, CD4(+)CD25(high) Tregs isolated from patients with active SLE expressed  reduced levels of FoxP3 mRNA and protein and poorly suppressed the proliferation  and cytokine secretion of CD4(+) effector T cells in vitro. In contrast, the expression of FoxP3 mRNA and protein and in vitro suppression of the proliferation of CD4(+) effector T cells by Tregs isolated from inactive SLE patients, was comparable to that of normal individuals. In vitro activation of CD4(+)CD25(high) Tregs from patients with active SLE increased FoxP3 mRNA and protein expression and restored their suppressive function. These data are the first to demonstrate a reversible defect in CD4(+)CD25(high) Treg function in patients with active SLE, and suggest that strategies to enhance the function of  these cells might benefit patients with this autoimmune disease.;2007-2009
203;Treatment with rituximab affects both the cellular and the humoral arm of the immune system in patients with SLE.;2007;Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.);Vallerskog T;"Herein we investigated how rituximab-induced B cell depletion affected leukocyte  subpopulations and antibody titers in SLE patients. We focused our analysis on time points related to absence and return of B cells after depletion. A correlation was found between the baseline frequency and time to repopulation; the fewer B cells initially, the longer to their return. While the few B cells remaining after treatment were of memory, double-negative (IgD-CD27-), and CD5+ phenotype, the returning B cells were mainly naive, indicating de novo production of B cells. Serum levels of IgG and antibodies against Ro52, Ro60, La44, measles  and tetanus remained unchanged, while decreases in IgM, IgE, anti-dsDNA and anti-C1q antibodies were observed. Additionally, a significant increase in activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as CD25bright FOXP3+ regulatory T cells  was observed. In conclusion, both the humoral and the cellular immune systems were affected by treatment with rituximab.";2007-2009
204;Effect of detoxification, removing stasis and nourishing yin method on corticosteroid-induced hyperlipidemia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Chinese journal of integrative medicine;Wen CP;OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of TCM therapy for detoxification, removing stasis, and nourishing yin on corticosteroid-induced hyperlipemia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and to investigate its mechanism. METHODS: One hundred and seventy patients with SLE were randomly assigned to the  integrative medicine group (IM group) and the Western medicine group (WM group),  85 in each group. Also, 30 healthy subjects selected from blood donors were enrolled in the normal control (NC) group. All patients were treated mainly with  prednisone, while those in the IM group were given TCM therapy additionally, and  the therapeutic course for both groups was 6 successive months. The changes of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and apolipoprotein A (ApoA) were determined and observed. A 2-year follow-up study was carried out in 16 patients  of the WM group and 25 of the IM group. RESULTS: Before treatment, no significant difference had been found among the three groups in the serum levels of lipids and lipoproteins. After the 6-month treatment, as compared with the WM group, the IM group showed lower levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, and VLDL-C (P<0.05 or P<0.01) and  higher levels of HDL-C and ApoA (P<0.05). A similar effect was also shown by the  follow-up study in the IM group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). CONCLUSION: TCM therapy for detoxification, removing stasis, and nourishing yin can effectively regulate the  levels of serum lipids and lipoproteins in preventing and treating SLE patients with corticosteroid-induced hyperlipemia.;2007-2009
205;British Isles Lupus Assessment Group 2004 index is valid for assessment of disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2007;Arthritis and rheumatism;Yee CS;OBJECTIVE: To determine the construct and criterion validity of the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group 2004 (BILAG-2004) index for assessing disease activity in  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Patients with SLE were recruited into a multicenter cross-sectional study. Data on SLE disease activity (scores on the BILAG-2004 index, Classic BILAG index, and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 [SLEDAI-2K]), investigations, and therapy were collected. Overall BILAG-2004 and overall Classic BILAG scores were determined by the highest score achieved in any of the individual systems in the respective index. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs), C3 levels, C4 levels, anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) levels, and SLEDAI-2K scores were used in the analysis of construct validity, and increase in therapy was used as the criterion for active disease in the analysis of criterion validity. Statistical analyses were performed using ordinal logistic regression for construct validity  and logistic regression for criterion validity. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 369 patients with SLE, 92.7% were women, 59.9% were white, 18.4% were Afro-Caribbean and 18.4% were South Asian. Their mean +/- SD age was 41.6 +/- 13.2 years and mean disease duration was 8.8 +/- 7.7 years. More than 1 assessment was obtained on 88.6% of the patients, and a total of 1,510 assessments were obtained. Increasing overall scores on the BILAG-2004 index were associated with increasing ESRs, decreasing C3 levels, decreasing C4 levels, elevated anti-dsDNA levels, and increasing SLEDAI-2K scores (all P < 0.01). Increase in therapy was observed more frequently in patients with overall BILAG-2004 scores reflecting higher disease activity. Scores indicating active disease (overall BILAG-2004 scores of A and B) were significantly associated with increase in therapy (odds ratio [OR] 19.3, P < 0.01). The BILAG-2004 and Classic  BILAG indices had comparable sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. CONCLUSION:  These findings show that the BILAG-2004 index has construct and criterion validity.;2007-2009
206;Low blood concentration of hydroxychloroquine is a marker for and predictor of disease exacerbations in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2006;Arthritis and rheumatism;Amoura Z;"OBJECTIVE: To study the possible relationship between whole-blood hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) concentrations and clinical efficacy of HCQ in patients  with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Whole-blood HCQ concentrations  were measured, under blinded conditions, in 143 unselected patients with SLE who  had been receiving HCQ 400 mg daily for at least 6 months. The relationship of these concentrations to current disease activity and to subsequent exacerbations  during 6 months of followup was investigated. RESULTS: At baseline, 23 patients had active disease (mean +/- SD SLE Disease Activity Index 12.4 +/- 7.5). The mean whole-blood HCQ concentration in this group was significantly lower than that in the 120 patients with inactive disease (694 +/- 448 ng/ml versus 1,079 +/- 526 ng/ml; P = 0.001). Among the 120 patients who had inactive disease at baseline, the mean HCQ concentration at baseline in the 14 (12%) who had disease  exacerbations during followup was significantly lower than that in the patients whose disease remained inactive. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the HCQ concentration was the only predictor of exacerbation (odds ratio 0.4 [95% confidence interval 0.18-0.85], P = 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that a whole-blood HCQ concentration cutoff of 1,000 ng/ml  had a negative predictive value of 96% for exacerbation during followup. CONCLUSION: Low whole-blood HCQ concentrations are associated with SLE disease activity and are a strong predictor of disease exacerbation. Regular drug assaying and individual tailoring of treatment might help to improve the efficacy of HCQ treatment in patients with SLE. ";2004-2006
207;Systemic lupus erythematosus in a multiethnic cohort: LUMINA XXXV. Predictive factors of high disease activity over time.;2006;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Alarcon GS;"AIM: To ascertain the predictive factors of high levels of disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with SLE (American College of Radiology criteria), aged >or=16 years, with disease duration <or=5 years and of Hispanic (Texas and Puerto Rico), African American and Caucasian ethnicities, were included. The outcome was high disease activity at any time (Systemic Lupus Activity Measure-Revised >10). A basic multivariable  model (including age, sex, ethnicity, health insurance, social support, abnormal  illness-related behaviours, helplessness and prior disease activity) was first examined. Additional models were built by including other variables. RESULTS: 554 patients (100 Hispanics from Texas, 94 Hispanics from Puerto Rico, 199 African Americans, 161 Caucasians) and 2366 visits were analysed; 47% of the patients and 29% of the visits met the definition of high disease activity (more common among  African Americans (72.0%) and Hispanics from Texas (71.3%) than among Caucasians  (43.9%) and Hispanics from Puerto Rico (31.9%)). Variables found to predict high  levels of disease activity were Hispanic (from Texas) and African American ethnicities, lack of health insurance, helplessness, abnormal illness-related behaviours and poor social support; age was negatively associated with high levels of disease activity. African admixture and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies also predicted high levels of disease activity, as did prior disease activity. None of the human leucocyte antigen variables were retained in the models. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic-demographic (age, ethnicity, health insurance), behavioural and psychological variables are important mediators of high levels of disease activity in SLE during its course. Interventions aimed at  modifiable factors may improve the outcomes of SLE.";2004-2006
208;A statistical analysis of the interrelationships between disease activity in different systems in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2006;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Allen E;OBJECTIVES: To develop models for disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to examine the hypothesis that possible subsets exist within the disease, notably renal disease and little else, mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal disease in isolation and more multisystem disease. METHODS: Four hundred and forty patients with SLE were followed for a period of 10 yr. Socio-demographic data were obtained at the first visit with disease activity being recorded at subsequent visits and damage scores at 6-monthly intervals. Prognostic factors for active disease in each of the mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal and renal systems were examined statistically. The results were then validated using data collected over 5 yr on a further 295 SLE patients from  a different centre. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses indicated that for all  three systems studied a patient known to have an involvement in that system is more likely to present with active disease in that same system than a patient with no known prior involvement. Patients with a higher frequency of clinic visits with active disease in a system are more likely to represent with active disease than those with fewer visits. The results suggest that renal disease is most likely to occur on its own. Associations between activity in the mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal systems support the suggestion that patients with musculoskeletal and mucocutaneous disease alone represent a possible subset  of SLE. None of the associations identified were modified by the medication a patient received. CONCLUSIONS: Previous disease history and involvement of other  systems determine a patient's chance of developing further episodes of active disease in SLE.;2004-2006
209;Predictors of post-partum damage accrual in systemic lupus erythematosus: data from LUMINA, a multiethnic US cohort (XXXVIII).;2006;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Andrade RM;"OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of pregnancy on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) outcome. METHODS: SLE patients, age >or=16 yrs, disease duration <or=5 yrs  at enrolment in LUMINA, a multiethnic cohort (Hispanics, African-Americans and Caucasians), were studied. The first pregnancy after SLE diagnosis was examined.  A good pregnancy outcome was a full-term delivery; an adverse outcome was a miscarriage, abortion, premature birth or stillbirth. Dependent variables were disease activity (Systemic Lupus Activity Measure-Revised, SLAM-R) and damage accrual [Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) Damage Index, SDI]. Differences in these variables between the visit immediately prior to, and  the first visit after, pregnancy and their relationship with pregnancy outcome were examined. Damage accrual due to pregnancy exposure was examined by a case-crossover design. RESULTS: Sixty-three SLE women from all ethnic groups were included. The mean (S.D.) age and disease duration at pregnancy outcome were 27.6 (6.5) yrs and 18.3 (22.5) months, respectively. Adverse pregnancy outcomes occurred in 76.2% women. The SLAM-R and SDI scores were statistically different after pregnancy (P = 0.050 and P < 0.001, respectively); the SDI score was independent of pregnancy outcome but strongly associated with pregnancy duration  (P = 0.006), disease activity (P = 0.001), damage prior to pregnancy (P < 0.001)  and total disease duration (P = 0.039) by multivariable analyses. Exposure to pregnancy itself did not impact on damage accrual in the case-crossover analyses  of 142 patients (17 pregnancy exposures) (OR = 1.25; 95% CI 0.336-4.655; P = 0.480). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy duration, total disease duration, disease activity and damage immediately prior to pregnancy decisively impact on damage accrual after pregnancy in patients with SLE.";2004-2006
210;Mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2006;Arthritis and rheumatism;Bernatsky S;"OBJECTIVE: To examine mortality rates in the largest systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cohort ever assembled. METHODS: Our sample was a multisite international SLE cohort (23 centers, 9,547 patients). Deaths were ascertained by vital statistics registry linkage. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR; ratio of deaths observed to deaths expected) estimates were calculated for all deaths and by cause. The effects of sex, age, SLE duration, race, and calendar-year periods were determined. RESULTS: The overall SMR was 2.4 (95% confidence interval 2.3-2.5). Particularly high mortality was seen for circulatory disease, infections, renal disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer. The highest SMR estimates were seen in patient groups characterized by female sex, younger age, SLE duration <1 year, or black/African American race. There was a dramatic decrease in total SMR estimates across calendar-year periods, which was demonstrable for specific causes including death due to infections and death due  to renal disorders. However, the SMR due to circulatory diseases tended to increase slightly from the 1970s to the year 2001. CONCLUSION: Our data from a very large multicenter international cohort emphasize what has been demonstrated  previously in smaller samples. These results highlight the increased mortality rate in SLE patients compared with the general population, and they suggest particular risk associated with female sex, younger age, shorter SLE duration, and black/African American race. The risk for certain types of deaths, primarily  related to lupus activity (such as renal disease), has decreased over time, while the risk for deaths due to circulatory disease does not appear to have diminished.";2004-2006
211;Mortality related to cerebrovascular disease in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2006;Lupus;Bernatsky S;"The objective of this study was to examine mortality rates related to cerebrovascular disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared to the general population. Our sample was a multisite Canadian SLE cohort (10 centres, n = 2688 patients). Deaths due to cerebrovascular disease were ascertained by vital statistics registry linkage using ICD diagnostic codes. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR, ratio of deaths observed to expected) estimates were calculated. The  total SMR for death due to cerebrovascular disease was 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0, 3.7). When considering specific types of events, the category  with the greatest increased risk was that of ill-defined cerebrovascular events (SMR 44.9 95% CI 9.3, 131.3) and other cerebrovascular disease (SMR 8.4, 95% CI 2.3, 21.6). Deaths due to cerebral infarctions appeared to be less common than hemorrhages and other types of cerebrovascular events. Our data suggest an increase in mortality related to cerebrovascular disease in SLE patients compared to the general population. The large increase in ill-defined cerebrovascular events may represent cases of cerebral vasculitis or other rare forms of nervous  system disease; alternately, it may reflect diagnostic uncertainty regarding the  etiology of some clinical presentations in SLE patients. The suggestion that more deaths are attributed to cerebral hemorrhage, as opposed to infarction, indicates that inherent or iatrogenic factors (eg, thrombocytopenia or anticoagulation) may be important. In view of the paucity of large-scale studies of mortality attributed to neuropsychiatric outcomes in SLE, our findings highlight the need for additional research in large SLE cohorts.";2004-2006

213;B cell depletion therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus: effect on autoantibody  and antimicrobial antibody profiles.;2006;Arthritis and rheumatism;Cambridge G;OBJECTIVE: Autoantibody production in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) is associated with abnormalities of B cell function and phenotype. Clinical responses to B cell depletion therapy (BCDT), based on rituximab, are encouraging. Therefore, we undertook this study to investigate the effect of BCDT on antibody profiles. METHODS: Serial sera from 16 patients with active, refractory SLE were assayed for antinucleosome antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), anti-extractable nuclear antigen, anti-tetanus toxoid, and antibodies to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide for at least 1 year following  BCDT. Anti-dsDNA antibodies derived from the V(H)4.34 immunoglobulin germ line gene (9G4+) were also measured. RESULTS: All patients achieved peripheral B cell  depletion and improved clinically for at least 3 months. Antinucleosome and anti-dsDNA antibodies decreased to a mean +/- SD of 64 +/- 37% and 38 +/- 33% of  baseline values, respectively, by 6-8 months post-BCDT. Levels of other autoantibodies and antimicrobial antibodies were generally unchanged. In the 9 of 16 patients who were still well at 1 year, anti-dsDNA antibodies fell to 42 +/- 36% of baseline values at 6-8 months and to 37 +/- 33% at 10-14 months. In patients who had disease flares within 1 year of BCDT, levels of these antibodies decreased to 60 +/- 40% and 83 +/- 93% of baseline values at 6-8 months and at 10-14 months, respectively. Circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies were positive for 9G4 expression in 4 of 6 patients tested, and flares in 2 of these patients were  accompanied by rises in 9G4+ anti-dsDNA antibodies. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that B cell clones committed to producing antinucleosome and anti-dsDNA antibodies, including the V(H)4.34 subpopulation of anti-dsDNA antibodies, have a relatively rapid turnover compared with B cell clones producing other antibodies. There was also a trend toward a greater and more sustained decrease in anti-dsDNA antibodies in patients with clinical benefit lasting >1 year.;2004-2006
214;Hepatocyte growth factor and transforming growth factor beta1 ratio at baseline can predict early response to cyclophosphamide in systemic lupus erythematosus nephritis.;2006;Arthritis and rheumatism;Capuano A;OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the ratio of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) nephritis could be a prognostic factor for response to therapy with cyclophosphamide (CYC) and steroids at 6 months, and to examine whether the molecular ratio of HGF to TGFbeta1 correlates with the activity index (AI) and chronicity index (CI) and has predictive value for remission at the sixth month.  METHODS: Thirty-six SLE patients with new-onset nephritis, 25 of whom were treated with CYC and steroids, entered into a prospective observational cohort trial at a tertiary university referral center. Renal biopsy findings and clinical parameters were recorded for all patients. Histopathologic, clinical, and immunohistochemical data at baseline served to define the predictive value for the outcome at 6 months. RESULTS: AI and CI at baseline did not distinguish patients who had achieved remission from those who had not achieved remission after receiving CYC plus steroids. HGF and TGFbeta1 were expressed in the tubuli, not in the glomeruli. The CI correlated directly with the TGFbeta1 extension score (TGFbeta1-ES) (r = 0.43, P = 0.008), but correlated indirectly with the HGF intensity score (HGF-IS) (r = -0.39, P = 0.02) and the HGF-ES (r = -0.45, P = 0.006). An HGF-ES:TGFbeta1-ES ratio of >or=1 at baseline distinguished patients who had achieved remission from those who had not achieved remission, with a predictive value of 94%. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that baseline expression of renal HGF and TGFbeta1 predicts short-term renal outcome after therapy with CYC and steroids.;2004-2006
215;Initial clinical trial of epratuzumab (humanized anti-CD22 antibody) for immunotherapy of systemic lupus erythematosus.;2006;Arthritis research & therapy;Dorner T;B cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), so the safety and activity of anti-B cell immunotherapy with the humanized anti-CD22 antibody epratuzumab was evaluated in SLE patients. An open-label, single-center study of 14 patients with moderately active SLE (total  British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) score 6 to 12) was conducted. Patients received 360 mg/m2 epratuzumab intravenously every 2 weeks for 4 doses with analgesic/antihistamine premedication (but no steroids) prior to each dose.  Evaluations at 6, 10, 18 and 32 weeks (6 months post-treatment) follow-up included safety, SLE activity (BILAG score), blood levels of epratuzumab, B and T cells, immunoglobulins, and human anti-epratuzumab antibody (HAHA) titers. Total  BILAG scores decreased by > or = 50% in all 14 patients at some point during the  study (including 77% with a > or = 50% decrease at 6 weeks), with 92% having decreases of various amounts continuing to at least 18 weeks (where 38% showed a  >/= 50% decrease). Almost all patients (93%) experienced improvements in at least one BILAG B- or C-level disease activity at 6, 10 and 18 weeks. Additionally, 3 patients with multiple BILAG B involvement at baseline had completely resolved all B-level disease activities by 18 weeks. Epratuzumab was well tolerated, with  a median infusion time of 32 minutes. Drug serum levels were measurable for at least 4 weeks post-treatment and detectable in most samples at 18 weeks. B cell levels decreased by an average of 35% at 18 weeks and remained depressed at 6 months post-treatment. Changes in routine safety laboratory tests were infrequent and without any consistent pattern, and there was no evidence of immunogenicity or significant changes in T cells, immunoglobulins, or autoantibody levels. In patients with mild to moderate active lupus, 360 mg/m2 epratuzumab was well tolerated, with evidence of clinical improvement after the first infusion and durable clinical benefit across most body systems. As such, multicenter controlled studies are being conducted in broader patient populations.;2004-2006
216;Right heart function in systemic lupus erythematosus: insights from myocardial Doppler tissue imaging.;2006;Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the;Gin PL;The purpose of this study was to use Doppler tissue imaging to evaluate heart function and to investigate the correlation between Doppler imaging and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Standard echocardiography and 2-dimensional and color Doppler imaging were used to assess cardiac function  in patients given the diagnosis of SLE (n = 40) and healthy control subjects (n = 45). Half of the patients with SLE also presented with pulmonary hypertension (PH). Significant differences in PASP and RV EF (RVEF) were found between the control and SLE groups. The peak systolic velocity of tricuspid annulus was significantly lower in patients with SLE than in the control group. The calculated myocardial performance index of the RV, septum, and left ventricular lateral wall were significantly higher in patients with SLE than in the control group. Bivariate correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation among PASP, RVEF, and systolic tricuspid annular velocity. There was a significant correlation between each of these 3 parameters and the 6-minute walk distance in  patients with SLE. Patients with SLE and PH had a significantly shorter 6-minute  walk distance than patients with SLE without PH. Furthermore, in patients with SLE and PH, RVEF and systolic tricuspid annular velocity were lower than in the control subjects and patients with SLE without PH. Patients with SLE and PH had a longer isovolumic relaxation time and a higher myocardial performance index of RV than those without PH. Finally, by simple linear regression analysis, we found a  significant positive relation between RVEF and systolic tricuspid annular velocity, but a negative relationship between PASP and systolic tricuspid annular velocity. These findings demonstrate that in patients with SLE, systolic tricuspid annular velocity determined by echocardiography and Doppler imaging can be used to assess RV function and PASP. Furthermore, systolic tricuspid annular velocity reflects exercise tolerance in patients with SLE and the length of the isovolumic relaxation time represents the progression of PH.;2004-2006
217;Diagnostic value of anti-nucleosome antibodies in the assessment of disease activity of systemic lupus erythematosus: a prospective study comparing anti-nucleosome with anti-dsDNA antibodies.;2006;The Journal of rheumatology;Gutierrez-Adrianzen OA;OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic value of anti-nucleosome antibodies in the assessment of clinically active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and active nephritis. METHODS: A 12 month prospective study of 87 patients diagnosed with SLE. At each evaluation, disease activity was scored by SLE Disease Activity Index and Lupus Activity Criteria Count, and blood samples were collected for laboratory tests. Autoantibodies were detected by ELISA. RESULTS: Nearly all patients were female (96.6%). The mean age was 33 years and the mean disease duration was 60.7 months. About half the patients presented with nephritis (49.4%) and active SLE (50.6%) at the first clinical examination. During the study period, the prevalence of active SLE decreased from 50.6% to 29.1%. The prevalence of anti-nucleosome and anti-dsDNA antibodies was 40.0%-58.6% and 10.9%-21.8%, respectively, throughout the study period. The sensitivity of anti-nucleosome and anti-dsDNA antibodies for active SLE was 72.7%-100% and 31.3%-54.8%, respectively. The specificity of anti-nucleosome and anti-dsDNA antibodies for active SLE was 66.7%-83.7% and 88.7%-100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of anti-nucleosome antibodies for active nephritis were 32.0%-67.5% and 46.2%-67.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for anti-dsDNA antibodies for active nephritis were 16.0%-35.4% and 85.1-97.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Anti-nucleosome antibodies are more sensitive than anti-dsDNA antibodies to active SLE and active nephritis. Thus, anti-nucleosome antibody reactivity may be a useful marker in the diagnosis and assessment of active SLE.;2004-2006
218;A proposal for a pediatric version of the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index based on the  analysis of 1,015 patients with juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus.;2006;Arthritis and rheumatism;Gutierrez-Suarez R;OBJECTIVE: To devise a modified version of the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI) for use in children and adolescents with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), based on the frequency and distribution of damage in patients with juvenile-onset SLE and the  sources of damage that are most suitable for inclusion in a pediatric damage index. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, damage was assessed through the SDI. Clinical assessments included evaluation of growth failure and delayed puberty, which were believed to be important sources of damage that are not incorporated in the SDI but should be included in a pediatric version of the instrument. RESULTS: A total of 1,015 patients with juvenile-onset SLE in 39 countries were enrolled in the study. Of these, 405 patients (39.9%) had an SDI score of > or =1 (mean +/- SD score 0.8 +/- 1.4). Renal damage (13%), neuropsychiatric damage (10.7%), and musculoskeletal damage (10.7%) were observed most frequently, followed by ocular damage (8.2%) and skin damage (7.6%). Growth  failure and delayed puberty were recorded in 15.3% and 11.3% of patients, respectively. A pediatric version of the SDI was devised, with inclusion of growth failure and delayed puberty as new domains. CONCLUSION: We propose a modified version of the SDI for use in patients with juvenile-onset SLE. This new instrument warrants prospective validation in other populations of patients seen  in different clinical or research settings.;2004-2006
219;Neuropsychiatric manifestations in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus and association with antiphospholipid antibodies.;2006;The Journal of rheumatology;Harel L;OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of neuropsychiatric (NP) manifestations in children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) using the 1999 American College  of Rheumatology case definitions for NP syndromes in SLE, and their association with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 106 pediatric and adolescent SLE patients at 2 academic medical centers. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained by medical record review. All aPL testing was performed in standard clinical laboratories. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (23.6%) had NP manifestations, including seizures (9.4%), headaches (4.7%), mood disorders (4.7%), cognitive dysfunction (4.7%), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), psychosis and pseudotumor (2.8% each), aseptic meningitis (0.9%), acute confusional state (0.9%), anxiety (0.9%), and cranial neuropathy (0.9%). NP events were not necessarily accompanied by an SLE flare. aPL were positive in 70% of all SLE patients, including anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in 64%, aCL IgG in 56%, aCL IgM in 35%, rapid plasma reagin or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test in 13%, and lupus anticoagulant (LAC) in 18%. The only significant association between NP manifestations and aPL was for CVA and IgM aCL (p=0.03). LAC was slightly more common among patients with NP events, and the finding of LAC on more than one occasion was significantly associated with developing a NP event (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: NP manifestations occur in about one-fourth of children with SLE, are an early event in the course of the disease, and are not necessarily accompanied by an SLE flare. Seizures are the most frequent symptom. Although aPL are common, their association with NP events, unlike in adults, is weak, except for CVA, suggesting a different pathogenic mechanism for NP manifestations in pediatric SLE.;2004-2006
220;The synergistic effect of FC gamma receptor IIa and interleukin-10 genes on the risk to develop systemic lupus erythematosus in Thai population.;2006;Tissue antigens;Hirankarn N;Several linkage analyses have consistently shown that systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptible genes are located on chromosome 1q21-44. In this  study, two major candidate genes, interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Fc gamma receptor IIa (FcgammaRIIa), within these regions were investigated in Thai SLE patients. The genotyping of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (promoter area: -1082, -819 and -592) within IL-10 gene and one polymorphism (change amino acid at position 131) within FcgammaRIIa gene was determined in 195 SLE patients and 159  ethnically matched controls. The RR/RH genotypes of FcgammaRIIa were found to be  significantly increased in SLE patients compared with healthy controls [OR = 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.28-3.14, P= 0.001]. Interestingly, the synergistic effect between RR/RH genotypes of FcgammaRIIa and ACC/ACC haplotype of IL-10 in susceptibility to SLE was observed (OR = 7.84, 95% CI = 1.60-52.04, P= 0.002). In addition, the FcgammaRIIa, RR homozygotes was also strongly associated with anticardiolipin antibody production (OR = 6.09, 95% CI = 1.38-30.54, P= 0.006). The result demonstrated that ACC haplotype of IL-10 gene and FcgammaRIIa R131 polymorphism can be used as marker for genetic susceptibility and severity to SLE in Thai population, particularly individuals carrying both specific genotypes.;2004-2006
221;Cost of illness in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus in Germany.;2006;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Huscher D;OBJECTIVE: To estimate and compare the direct and indirect costs of illness in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and to evaluate the effect of sex, disease duration and functional status on the various cost domains. METHODS: Data of outpatients, aged 18-65, with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 4351), ankylosing spondylitis (n = 827), PsA (n = 908) or SLE (n = 844), who were enrolled in the national database of the German collaborative arthritis centres in 2002, were analysed. Data on healthcare consumption, out-of-pocket expenses and productivity losses were derived from doctors and patients. For the calculation of indirect costs, the human capital approach (HCA) and the friction cost approach (FCA) were applied. RESULTS: Mean direct costs amounted to 4737 euros a year in rheumatoid arthritis, 3676 euros in ankylosing spondylitis, 3156 euros in PsA and 3191 euros in SLE. By using the HCA, total costs were calculated at 15,637 euros in rheumatoid arthritis, 13,513 euros in ankylosing spondylitis, 11,075 euros in PsA and 14,411 euros in SLE, whereas with the FCA the numbers were 7899 euros, 7204 euros, 5570 euros and 6518 euros, respectively. Costs increased with disease duration and were strongly dependent on functional status. In patients with the highest disability (<50% of full function), the total costs on applying the HCA were 34,915 euros in rheumatoid arthritis, 29,647 euros in alkylosing spondylitis, 37,440 euros in PsA and 32,296 euros in SLE. CONCLUSION: The costs of illness are high in all four diseases, with a strong effect of functional status on total costs. Indirect costs differ by the factor 3, based on whether the HCA or the FCA is used.;2004-2006
222;Aortic valve calcification in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2006;Lupus;Kiani AN;Aortic valve calcification is associated with atherosclerosis in the general population. We investigated the prevalence of and associates of aortic valve calcification in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). One-hundred and ninety-nine  SLE patients enrolled in a clinical trial had aortic valve calcification assessed by helical CT. The patients had a mean age of 44.3 +/- 11.4 years and were 92% female, 61% Caucasian, 34% African-American, 2% Asian and 2% Hispanic. Aortic valve calcification was present in 1.5%, whereas coronary calcium was found in 43% and carotid plaque in 17%. Among cardiovascular risk factors, hs-CRP (P = 0.0592), fibrinogen (P = 0.0507), and lipoprotein(a) (P = 0.0250), were associated with aortic valve calcification. Prednisone use (P = 0.049) and use of methotrexate (P = 0.0174) were also associated with aortic valve calcification. Aortic valve calcification was associated with antiphospholipid antibody positivity (0.0287) (lupus anticoagulant, by dilute Russell viper venom time). It was not associated with coronary calcium or carotid plaque. Aortic valve calcification, although rare in SLE, was associated with some novel cardiovascular risk factors and with a marker of hypercoagulability (lupus anticoagulant). In contrast to the general population, aortic valve calcification in SLE is not associated with subclinical measures of atherosclerosis, such as coronary calcium or carotid plaque.;2004-2006
223;The different immunomodulation of indirect moxibustion on normal subjects and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2006;The American journal of Chinese medicine;Kung YY;Moxibustion has been thought to enhance immunity in healthy condition, but suppress abnormal immune response in disease status. We collected 12 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 12 healthy women who received indirect moxibustion on acupuncture points ST-36 (Zusanli) and SP-6 (Sanyinjiao)  20 minutes per day for 1 week. During the course, there were no changes of their  regular medications or intercurrent infections in normal subjects and SLE patients. We found that indirect moxibustion for 1 week could elevate CD3+ and CD4+ T-lymphocytes in normal subjects, whereas decrease relative proportions of CD8+ T-lymphocytes in patients with SLE. This result confirms that indirect moxibustion has different immunomodulation in normal condition and autoimmune status. However, whether immunomodulatory effects of indirect moxibustion are beneficial for normal subjects and patients with SLE require further confirmation.;2004-2006
224;Prevention of gonadal toxicity and preservation of gonadal function and fertility in young women with systemic lupus erythematosus treated by cyclophosphamide: the PREGO-Study.;2006;Autoimmunity reviews;Manger K;BACKGROUND: With dramatically improved survival rates of SLE patients, comorbidity and long-term damage such as premature ovarian failure (POF) gain increasing importance. In the Erlangen cohort, 14% of cyclophosphamide treated patients younger than 41 years have POF, which is a common consequence of cyclophosphamide treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We tested the concentrations of FSH and LH, before, during and after cyclophosphamide treatment in 63 premenopausal women with SLE without ovarian protection and initiated the PREGO-Study (Prospective randomized study on protection against gonadal toxicity) in patients with SLE. RESULTS: In lupus patients treated with cyclophosphamide, 60% suffered from POF and hypergonadotropic amenorrhea. Whereas the POF rate was  <50% in women below 30 years, it was 60% between 30 and 40 years. The cumulative  dosage of cyclophosphamide also strongly influenced POF rate. CONCLUSIONS: Our present results, with a high POF rate in Cyclophosphamide treated SLE patients demonstrate the urgent need for ovarian protection in this patient group. Besides POF these women are at high risk for premature atherosclerosis which is the major cause of death in lupus. Following preliminary encouraging experience in women with lymphoma, in whom the temporary induction of a prepubertal hormonal milieu during chemotherapy, has significantly decreased the risk of POF, we have initiated the PREGO-Study, comparing randomised monthly injection versus no injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH-a) to young SLE patients during cyclophosphamide therapy.;2004-2006
225;Prevention of steroid-induced osteonecrosis of femoral head in systemic lupus erythematosus by anti-coagulant.;2006;Lupus;Nagasawa K;"Although osteonecrosis of femoral head (ONF) is one of the serious complications  in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) associated with corticosteroid therapy, there has been few trials of prevention of ONF described. We aimed to prevent ONF in steroid-treated SLE patients using anticoagulant, warfarin, conducting a multicenter prospective study. Sixty newly diagnosed SLE patients requiring 40 mg/day or more prednisolone were alternately assigned to either of two groups; a  warfarin group and a control one. Warfarin (1 to approximately 5 mg/day) was started together with the beginning of steroid therapy and continued at least for three months. Patients were observed for the development of silent ONF by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and symptomatic ONF by plain radiography for over five years. The warfarin group consisted of 31 patients (62 hips) and the control one 29 patients (58 hips). Silent ONF developed in 13 hips (21%) and 19 hips (33%) in the warfarin group and the control group, respectively (P = 0.13).  On the other hand, warfarin tended to prevent symptomatic ONF; only three hips of 62 (4.8 %) in the warfarin group and eight hips of 58 (14%) in the control group  (P = 0.08) developed silent ONF. It was also found that silent ONF developed, if  it did, very early; within three months in 16 of 18 patients (89%). Among risk factors for silent ONF, steroid pulse therapy was most outstanding and it seemed  to overcome the effect of warfarin. Taken together, for the time being, anti-coagulant therapy, if not significantly sufficient, may be of use for the prevention of steroid-induced ONF in SLE. We consider that this study added to important evidence for the pathogenesis and prevention of ONF.";2004-2006
226;Study of the role of functional variants of SLC22A4, RUNX1 and SUMO4 in systemic  lupus erythematosus.;2006;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Orozco G;BACKGROUND: Functional polymorphisms of the solute carrier family 22, member 4 (SLC22A4), runt related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) and small ubiquitin-like modifier 4 (SUMO4) genes have been shown to be associated with several autoimmune diseases. OBJECTIVE: To test the possible role of these variants in susceptibility to or severity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), on the basis that common genetic bases are shared by autoimmune disorders. METHODS: 597 SLE patients and 987 healthy controls of white Spanish origin were studied. Two additional cohorts of 228 SLE patients from Sweden and 122 SLE patients from Colombia were included. A case-control association study was carried out with six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) spanning the SLC22A4 gene, one SNP in RUNX1 gene, and one additional SNP in SUM04 gene. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between SLE patients and healthy controls when comparing the distribution of the genotypes or alleles of any of the SLC22A4, RUNX1, or SUMO4 polymorphisms tested. Significant differences were found in the distribution of the SUMO4 genotypes and alleles among SLE patients with and without nephritis, but after multiple testing correction, the significance of the association was lost. The association of SUMO4 with nephritis could not be verified in two independent SLE cohorts from Sweden and Colombia. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the SLC22A4, RUNX1, and SUMO4 polymorphisms analysed do not play a role in the susceptibility to or severity of SLE.;2004-2006
227;Comparison of a self-report and performance-based test of disability in people with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2006;Disability and rehabilitation;Poole JL;PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine functional ability in people with SLE by comparing a self-report and a performance-based test. METHOD: Fifteen women with SLE and 15 healthy controls participated in this study. Participants completed a self report of daily living skills, the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Actual performance during activities of daily living was evaluated with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS). Measures of cognition and disease activity were also collected. RESULTS: HAQ scores of the participants with SLE indicated only very mild disability while scores on the AMPS indicated ineffective skill performance and potential safety risks. In the participants with SLE, cognitive status correlated significantly with the processing component (r(s) = 0.62, p < 0.05) and disease severity correlated with the motor component of the AMPS (r(s) = 0.84, p < 0.001). The HAQ did not correlate with the AMPS. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that cognitive deficits were more related to scores on the performance-based test of functional ability rather than the self-report. The performance-based test appeared to provide information that was not gained through self-report and measures of disease activity and gross cognition.;2004-2006
228;Chloroquine treatment influences proinflammatory cytokine levels in systemic lupus erythematosus patients.;2006;Lupus;Wozniacka A;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with a complex pathogenesis. Published data have revealed that serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines are increased in SLE patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether monotherapy with chloroquine phosphate affects IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-18 and  TNF-alpha serum levels in SLE patients. The study group consisted of 25 SLE patients with mild or moderate disease activity and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. In SLE patients the cytokine levels were measured just  before and three months after starting chloroquine treatment at a dose of 125 mg  twice daily. Although the majority of SLE patients had a low systemic lupus activity measure (SLAM) index, the levels of IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-alpha were significantly higher than in the control group. After three-months of chloroquine therapy the mean level of IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-alpha decreased significantly. Minimal erythema doses (MEDs) were significantly increased in SLE patients after  three months of chloroquine therapy. The results indicate that chloroquine treatment lowers some proinflammatory cytokines and may provide a photoprotective effect. ;2004-2006
229;Efficacy of cyclosporin-A in the long-term management of thrombocytopenia associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2006;Lupus;Quartuccio L;Thrombocytopenia frequently complicates systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and its long-term management may be problematic. Intravenous immunoglobulins and high doses of steroids are often effective as induction therapy, but thrombocytopenia  frequently relapses during steroid tapering. Several immunosuppressive agents have been evaluated as induction or maintenance therapy in small series or in case reports. We describe six consecutive unselected SLE patients where cyclosporin-A (CyA) was effective and safe in the long-term management of thrombocytopenia and allowed steroid tapering. One relapse occurred during CyA reduction and responded to CyA dose adjustment. Steroids could be stopped in three out of six patients, and were maintained at very low doses in the remaining patients. CyA was stopped in one patient after one year of treatment, without relapse at month 11+ from discontinuation. No severe side effects were documented. Overall, these data suggest that CyA may prove to be an effective and safe therapeutic option for SLE-related thrombocytopenia.;2004-2006
230;Is disturbed clearance of apoptotic keratinocytes responsible for UVB-induced inflammatory skin lesions in systemic lupus erythematosus?;2006;Arthritis research & therapy;Reefman E;Apoptotic cells are thought to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We hypothesise that delayed or altered clearance of apoptotic cells after UV irradiation will lead to inflammation in the skin of SLE patients. Fifteen SLE patients and 13 controls were irradiated with two minimal erythemal doses (MEDs) of ultraviolet B light (UVB). Subsequently, skin biopsies were analysed (immuno)histologically, over 10 days, for numbers of apoptotic cells, T cells, macrophages, and deposition of immunoglobulin and complement. Additionally, to compare results with cutaneous lesions of SLE patients, 20 biopsies of lupus erythematosus (LE) skin lesions were analysed morphologically for apoptotic cells and infiltrate. Clearance rate  of apoptotic cells after irradiation did not differ between patients and controls. Influx of macrophages in dermal and epidermal layers was significantly  increased in patients compared with controls. Five out of 15 patients developed a dermal infiltrate that was associated with increased epidermal influx of T cells  and macrophages but not with numbers of apoptotic cells or epidermal deposition of immunoglobulins. Macrophages were ingesting multiple apoptotic bodies. Inflammatory lesions in these patients were localised near accumulations of apoptotic keratinocytes similar as was seen in the majority of LE skin lesions. In vivo clearance rate of apoptotic cells is comparable between SLE patients and  controls. However, the presence of inflammatory lesions in the vicinity of apoptotic cells, as observed both in UVB-induced and in LE skin lesions in SLE patients, suggests that these lesions result from an inflammatory clearance of apoptotic cells.;2004-2006
231;The Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization/American College of  Rheumatology provisional criteria for the evaluation of response to therapy in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus: prospective validation of the definition of improvement.;2006;Arthritis and rheumatism;Ruperto N;OBJECTIVE: To use the Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) core set of outcome measures to develop a validated definition of improvement for the evaluation of response to therapy in juvenile systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Thirty-seven experienced pediatric rheumatologists  from 27 countries, each of whom had specific experience in the assessment of juvenile SLE patients, achieved consensus on 128 patient profiles as being clinically improved or not improved. Using the physicians' consensus ratings as the gold standard measure, the chi-square, sensitivity, specificity, false-positive and false-negative rates, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and kappa level of agreement for 597 candidate definitions  of improvement were calculated. Only definitions with a kappa value greater than  0.7 were retained. The top definitions were selected based on the product of the  content validity score multiplied by its kappa statistic. RESULTS: The definition of improvement with the highest final score was at least 50% improvement from baseline in any 2 of the 5 core set measures, with no more than 1 of the remaining worsening by more than 30%. CONCLUSION: PRINTO proposes a valid and reproducible definition of improvement that reflects well the consensus rating of experienced clinicians and that incorporates clinically meaningful change in core set measures in a composite end point for the evaluation of global response to therapy in patients with juvenile SLE. The definition is now proposed for use in  juvenile SLE clinical trials and may help physicians to decide whether a child with SLE responded adequately to therapy.;2004-2006
232;Long-term comparison of rituximab treatment for refractory systemic lupus erythematosus and vasculitis: Remission, relapse, and re-treatment.;2006;Arthritis and rheumatism;Smith KG;"OBJECTIVE: Current treatments for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis contribute to mortality and incapacity and are only partially effective; thus, newer therapies are clearly needed. Depletion of B cells has led to disease control in patients with autoimmune disorders. We sought to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of a B cell-depleting therapy in patients with SLE  and patients with vasculitis. METHODS: In a prospective study with a median followup of 24 months, 11 patients with active or refractory SLE and 11 patients  with active or refractory antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) received a course of therapy with rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) along with a single dose of intravenous cyclophosphamide. RESULTS: Remission followed rapid B cell depletion, with response rates of 100% among the 11 patients with SLE (6 patients had a complete response, and 5 patients had a partial response) and 91% among the 11 patients with AAV (9 patients had a complete response, and 1 patient had partial remission). A renal response occurred in all 6 patients with lupus nephritis. Clinical improvement was accompanied by significant reductions in the daily dose of prednisolone. Relapse occurred in 64% of the patients with SLE and in 60% of those with AAV. B  cell return preceded relapse in the majority of patients, and further treatment with rituximab proved effective. IgG and IgM levels were maintained in the normal range. The incidence of infective complications was low; however, infusion reactions were common, and human antichimeric antibodies developed in 5 of 14 patients. CONCLUSION: B cell depletion offers the prospect of sustained disease remission and improved disease control combined with low toxicity in patients with active or refractory SLE or AAV. Relapse following treatment is common, but  re-treatment is rapidly effective.";2004-2006
233;The reduction of serum B-lymphocyte activating factor levels following quinacrine add-on therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2006;Scandinavian journal of immunology;Toubi E;B-Lymphocyte-activating factor (BAFF/BLyS) is a survival factor for B cells, belonging to the tumor necrosis ligand super family. Serum BAFF levels have been  found to be elevated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Neutralization of BAFF activity was suggested as an additional therapeutic approach in SLE. To determine the effect of add-on Quinacrine (Qn) treatment on serum BAFF levels and the effect of this treatment on SLE disease activity index  (SLEDAI), antidsDNA and anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody levels, we treated 29 stable SLE patients, who were maintained on prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine and in some on azathioprine (AZT), with additional Qn (100 mg/d) with an aim to further reduce disease activity. SLEDAI, antidsDNA, aCL antibodies and serum BAFF levels were assessed before and 3 months after the addition of Qn. Three months following Qn initiation, a reduction in SLEDAI was noticed in 19/29 patients (mean 8.8 +/- 2.3 to 3.3 +/- 1.5, P = 0.009), followed by reduction or discontinuation of prednisolone in all patients and the discontinuation of AZT in five patients. Serum BAFF levels were significantly reduced in 8/12 patients (mean 6.3 +/- 0.5 to 3.0 +/- 0.56 ng/ml P = 0.0001). This reduction was found in  correlation with a decrease in aCL titres. However, the decrease in SLEDAI scores and antidsDNA antibody titres was unrelated to the decrease in serum BAFF or aCL  levels. We conclude that the addition of Qn to previous therapeutic regimens in active SLE is beneficial and seems to reduce SLEDAI scores, serum BAFF and aCL levels and therefore should be considered in many of our SLE patients before aggressive treatments are given. ;2004-2006
234;Pilot clinical study of Adacolumn cytapheresis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2006;Rheumatology international;Soerensen H;"The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical effects of cytapheresis using the Adacolumn system (selective removal of circulating monocytes and granulocytes by means of an extracorporeal type column) in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). An open uncontrolled multicenter pilot study  was conducted in 18 SLE patients who were showing a SLEDAI score of 8 or more under conventional medication. Patients with lupus nephritis (>class 1, WHO classification) were excluded. Extracorporeal cytapheresis with the Adacolumn system was administered once a week for five consecutive weeks. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated using the SLEDAI for 10 weeks after the first cytapheresis session. The median SLEDAI decreased from 16 at baseline to six at week 11 (10 weeks after the first apheresis) (p<0.001). Significant improvements  in musculoskeletal and dermal systems were observed. Arthritis and alopecia were  present in 14 and nine patients at baseline and this number decreased to five and one patients, respectively by week 11. Three mild and one moderate adverse events out of the 42 reported events were judged 'probably related' to the treatment; no serious adverse events were reported. Selective removal of monocytes and granulocytes from the blood in an extracorporeal circulation system was associated with clinical improvement in this small series of patients with SLE. Since this approach seems not to have the disadvantages of pharmacological immunosuppression, further controlled studies of Adacolumn cytapheresis are warranted in SLE.";2004-2006
235;The effect of moderate-dose corticosteroids in preventing severe flares in patients with serologically active, but clinically stable, systemic lupus erythematosus: findings of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.;2006;Arthritis and rheumatism;Tseng CE;OBJECTIVE: Serial measurements of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and complement are routine in the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but their utility as biomarkers in preemptive treatment to prevent flares remains a subject of controversy. We hypothesized that concomitant elevation of anti-dsDNA and C3a can predict SLE activity in patients with stable or inactive disease and that short-term treatment with corticosteroids can avert flares. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 154 patients were evaluated monthly for up to 18 months, with measurements of C3a, C3, C4, CH50, and anti-dsDNA levels. Patients who remained clinically stable but showed serologic evidence of an SLE flare (elevation of both the anti-dsDNA level by 25% and the C3a level by 50% over the previous 1-2 monthly visits) were  randomized to receive either prednisone or placebo therapy at a dosage of 30 mg/day for 2 weeks, 20 mg/day for 1 week, and 10 mg/day for 1 week. RESULTS: Forty-one patients (21 randomized to prednisone and 20 randomized to placebo) experienced a serologic flare. Analysis of severe flares occurring <or=90 days from randomization revealed that 6 occurred in patients taking placebo and none occurred in patients taking prednisone (P = 0.007). Severe flares resulted in an  increase in the prednisone dosage to >40 mg/day and/or the addition of an immunosuppressive agent. Furthermore, improvement in scores on the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index, decreased levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies,  and increased levels of C4 occurred 1 month after initiation of prednisone treatment. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data support our hypothesis that in a subset of clinically stable SLE patients with a combination of elevated C3a and anti-dsDNA levels, short-term corticosteroid therapy may avert a severe flare.;2004-2006
236;Differential effects on BAFF and APRIL levels in rituximab-treated patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.;2006;Arthritis research & therapy;Vallerskog T;The objective of this study was to investigate the interaction between levels of  BAFF (B-cell activation factor of the tumour necrosis factor [TNF] family) and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand) and B-cell frequencies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with the B-cell-depleting agent rituximab. Ten patients with SLE were treated with rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. They were followed longitudinally up to 6 months after B-cell repopulation. Nine patients with RA, resistant or intolerant to anti-TNF therapy, treated with rituximab plus methotrexate were investigated up to 6 months after treatment. The B-cell frequency was determined by flow cytometry, and serum levels of BAFF and APRIL were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. BAFF levels rose significantly during B-cell depletion in both patient groups, and in patients with SLE the BAFF levels declined close to pre-treatment levels upon B-cell repopulation. Patients with SLE had normal levels of APRIL at baseline, and during depletion there was a significant decrease. In contrast, patients with RA  had APRIL levels 10-fold higher than normal, which did not change during depletion. At baseline, correlations between levels of B cells and APRIL, and DAS28 (disease activity score using 28 joint counts) and BAFF were observed in patients with RA. In summary, increased BAFF levels were observed during absence  of circulating B cells in our SLE and RA patient cohorts. In spite of the limited number of patients, our data suggest that BAFF and APRIL are differentially regulated in different autoimmune diseases and, in addition, differently affected by rituximab treatment.;2004-2006
237;Sicca symptoms in Thai patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma: a comparison with age-matched controls and correlation with disease variables.;2006;Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology / launched by the Allergy and;Wangkaew S;This study was performed to determine the prevalence of ocular and oral sicca symptoms in Thai patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and scleroderma (Scl). The ocular symptoms and sign (the Schirmer's 1 test) and the oral sicca symptoms and sign (the Saxon's test) in each of 50 RA, SLE and Scl patients were compared with their age-matched controls. The correlation between the presence of sicca symptoms and signs with their clinical activity was also determined. Ocular sicca symptoms were found more common in patients with RA (38% vs 18%, p < 0.05), SLE (36% vs 14%, p < 0.05) and Scl (54% vs 16%, p < 0.01), and oral sicca symptoms were found more common in SLE (22% vs 0%, p < 0.01), and Scl (16% vs 4%, p < 0.05) than their controls. However, only RA patients had a significantly higher proportion of positive Schimer-1 test compared with their controls (p < 0.01). There was no strong correlation between sicca symptoms or signs and other clinical or laboratory variables (age, disease duration, disease activity, disease severity,  and antibody to Ro and La antigens) in these three groups. In conclusion, sicca symptoms were seen significantly more common in Thai patients with connective tissue diseases, but the symptoms did not show a good correlation with the clinical and laboratory variables.;2004-2006
238;Smoking, drinking, sleeping habits, and other lifestyle factors and the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus in Japanese females: findings from the KYSS study.;2006;Modern rheumatology / the Japan Rheumatism Association;Washio M;Many risk factors have been proposed for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, there is little information about the relationship between lifestyles and SLE in Japan. Two case control studies were conducted in Kyushu, southern Japan, and in Hokkaido, northern Japan, to examine the relationship between lifestyles and development of SLE in females. The participants were 78 patients and 329 controls in Kyushu and 35 patients and 188 controls in Hokkaido. Smoking  was associated with an increased risk of SLE after adjusting for age in both regions. However, in Hokkaido, this association between smoking and SLE did not reach statistical significance after adjusting for alcohol drinking. The present  study suggests that smoking may increase the risk of SLE among Japanese females.;2004-2006
239;Rituximab therapy for childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus.;2006;The Journal of pediatrics;Willems M;"OBJECTIVE: To describe the safety and efficacy of rituximab in the treatment of childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a  French multicenter retrospective study of childhood-onset SLE treated with rituximab. RESULTS: Eleven girls with severe SLE, including 8 girls with class IV or V lupus nephritis, 2 girls with severe autoimmune cytopenia, and 1 girl with antiprothrombin antibody with severe hemorrhage, were treated with rituximab. The mean age at onset of rituximab treatment was 13.9 years. Patients received 2 to 12 intravenous infusions of rituximab (350-450 mg/m2/infusion), with corticosteroids. Six patients also received different standard immunosuppressive  agents, including Cyclophosphamide (2 patients). Remission was achieved in 6 of 8 patients with lupus nephritis and in the 2 patients with autoimmune cytopenia. Steroid therapy was tapered in 5 patients who responded to treatment, and low-dose prednisone treatment was maintained in 1 patient. The mean follow-up period was 13.2 months (range, 6-26 months), and remission lasted in all who patients who responded to treatment, except 1 patient who was successfully retreated with a second course of rituximab. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibody levels decreased in 6 of 11 patients, and anticardiolipin antibody levels decreased in 3 of 4 patients. Severe adverse events developed in 5 patients. Effective depletion of peripheral blood B cells was observed in 7 of 8 patients who were examined, and this paralleled the remission. CONCLUSION: Rituximab may be an effective co-therapy; however, further investigations are required because  severe adverse events occurred in 45% of the patients in this study.";2004-2006
240;Revised British Isles Lupus Assessment Group 2004 index: a reliable tool for assessment of systemic lupus erythematosus activity.;2006;Arthritis and rheumatism;Yee CS;OBJECTIVE: To test the interrater reliability of the revised British Isles Lupus  Assessment Group 2004 (BILAG-2004) index for the assessment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) activity. METHODS: Patients with SLE were recruited from 11 centers. Two physician raters separately assessed the patients' disease activity  using the BILAG-2004 index in routine clinical practice. Scores ranged from A (for very active disease) to E (for inactivity). Two reliability exercises were performed. Changes were made to the index after the first exercise (E1), and additional training was provided to the raters before the second exercise (E2). E1 and E2 involved 12 and 14 raters, respectively. Interrater reliability was assessed using kappa statistics and intraclass correlation coefficients. Levels of agreement and the extent of major disagreement were also examined. Major disagreement was defined as a score difference between raters of A versus C, D, or E or B versus D or E. RESULTS: For each exercise, 97 patients were recruited.  In E1, the mean age of the patients was 42.3 years (range 18.5-82.2 years), 89.7% were women, and 74.2% were white, 8.2% were Afro-Caribbean, and 13.4% were South  Asian, and in E2, the mean age was 43.7 years (range 17.7-75 years), 90.7% were women, and 68% were white, 15.5% were Afro-Caribbean, and 11.3% were South Asian. The mean disease duration was 9.4 years (range 0-32.1 years) for patients in E1 and 10 years (range 0-34.8 years) in E2. There was improvement in the interrater  reliability and the level of agreement from E1 to E2. Further improvement was achieved after removal of poorly performing items. CONCLUSION: The BILAG-2004 index is a reliable tool to assess SLE activity. The use of a well-defined glossary and training of raters are essential to ensure the optimal performance of the index.;2004-2006
241;Familial aggregation of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases in 1,177 lupus patients from the GLADEL cohort.;2005;Arthritis and rheumatism;Alarcon-Segovia D;OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is familial aggregation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or other autoimmune diseases in SLE patients and to identify clinical differences between patients with and those without familial autoimmunity. METHODS: We interviewed members of the Grupo Latinoamericano de Estudio del Lupus Eritematoso (GLADEL) inception cohort of 1,214 SLE patients to  ascertain whether they had relatives with SLE and/or other autoimmune diseases. Identified relatives were studied. Familial aggregation was tested using reported highest and intermediate population prevalence data for SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or all autoimmune diseases, and studies were performed to identify the genetic model applicable for SLE. RESULTS: We identified 116 first-, second-, or  third-degree relatives with SLE, 79 with RA, 23 with autoimmune thyroiditis, 3 with scleroderma, 1 with polymyositis, and 16 with other autoimmune diseases, related to 166 of the 1,177 SLE patients in the GLADEL cohort who agreed to participate. Forty-two SLE patients had 2 or more relatives with an autoimmune disease. We found a lambda(sibling) of 5.8 and 29.0 for SLE and of 3.2-5.3 for RA, when comparing with their reported high or intermediate population prevalence, respectively. We also found familial aggregation for autoimmune disease in general (lambda(sibling) = 1.5) and determined that for SLE, a polygenic additive genetic model, rather than a multiplicative one, is applicable. CONCLUSION: In SLE there is familial aggregation of SLE, RA, and autoimmune disease in general. A polygenic additive model applies for SLE. American Indian-white Mestizo SLE patients and those with higher socioeconomic level were more likely to have familial autoimmunity.;2004-2006
242;Controlled clinical trial of IV cyclophosphamide versus IV methylprednisolone in  severe neurological manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Barile-Fabris L;BACKGROUND: Severe neurological involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is one of the most dreadful complications of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To identify the best drug, dose, and treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was  a controlled clinical trial at two tertiary care centres of patients with SLE according to the ACR criteria, with incident (no more than 15 days) onset of severe NP manifestations such as seizures, optic neuritis, peripheral or cranial  neuropathy, coma, brainstem disease, or transverse myelitis. Induction treatment  with 3 g of IV methylprednisolone (MP) followed by either IV monthly cyclophosphamide (Cy) versus IV MP bimonthly every 4 months for 1 year and then IV Cy or IV MP every 3 months for another year. The primary end point was response to treatment: at least 20% improvement from basal conditions on clinical, laboratory, or specific neurological testing variables. RESULTS: Overall, a response rate of 75% was observed. Of the 32 patients studied, 18/19 receiving Cy and 7/13 receiving MP responded to treatment (p<0.03). CONCLUSIONS:  Cy seems to be more effective than MP in the treatment of acute, severe NPSLE.;2004-2006
243;Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Bernatsky S;BACKGROUND: Recent evidence supports an association between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). OBJECTIVES: To describe demographic factors, subtypes, and survival of patients with SLE who develop NHL. METHODS: A multi-site cohort of 9547 subjects with definite SLE was assembled. Subjects at each centre were linked to regional tumour registries to determine cancer cases occurring after SLE diagnosis. For the NHL cases ascertained, descriptive statistics were calculated, and NHL subtype frequency and median survival time of patients determined. RESULTS: 42 cases of NHL occurred in the patients with SLE during the 76,948 patient-years of observation. The median age  of patients at NHL diagnosis was 57 years. Thirty six (86%) of the 42 patients developing NHL were women, reflecting the female predominance of the cohort. In the patients, aggressive histological subtypes appeared to predominate, with the  most commonly identified NHL subtype being diffuse large B cell (11 out of 21 cases for which histological subtype was available). Twenty two of the patients had died a median of 1.2 years after lymphoma diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data  suggest aggressive disease in patients with SLE who develop NHL. Continuing work  should provide further insight into the patterns of presentation, prognosis, and  aetiology of NHL in SLE.;2004-2006
244;An international cohort study of cancer in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Arthritis and rheumatism;Bernatsky S;"OBJECTIVE: There is increasing evidence in support of an association between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and malignancy, but in earlier studies the association could not be quantified precisely. The present study was undertaken to ascertain the incidence of cancer in SLE patients, compared with that in the general population. METHODS: We assembled a multisite (23 centers) international  cohort of patients diagnosed as having SLE. Patients at each center were linked to regional tumor registries to determine cancer occurrence. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated as the ratio of observed to expected cancers. Cancers expected were determined by multiplying person-years in the cohort by the geographically matched age, sex, and calendar year-specific cancer  rates, and summing over all person-years. RESULTS: The 9,547 patients from 23 centers were observed for a total of 76,948 patient-years, with an average followup of 8 years. Within the observation interval, 431 cancers occurred. The data confirmed an increased risk of cancer among patients with SLE. For all cancers combined, the SIR estimate was 1.15 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.05-1.27), for all hematologic malignancies, it was 2.75 (95% CI 2.13-3.49), and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, it was 3.64 (95% CI 2.63-4.93). The data also suggested an increased risk of lung cancer (SIR 1.37; 95% CI 1.05-1.76), and hepatobiliary cancer (SIR 2.60; 95% CI 1.25, 4.78). CONCLUSION: These results support the notion of an association between SLE and cancer and more precisely define the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in SLE. It is not yet known whether this association is mediated by genetic factors or exogenous exposures.";2004-2006
245;Double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial of clofazimine compared with  chloroquine in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Arthritis and rheumatism;Bezerra EL;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of clofazimine (CFZ) compared with chloroquine diphosphate (CDP) for the treatment of cutaneous involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial was carried out in SLE patients with active cutaneous lesions, of whom 16 were randomized to receive CFZ at 100 mg/day and 17 received CDP at 250 mg/day for 6 months. All drugs had a similar appearance to avoid identification. Both groups received broad-spectrum sunscreens twice a day and the prednisone dose was kept stable during the study.  Cutaneous lesions were evaluated by 2 blinded observers at baseline and at months 1, 2, 4, and 6. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were randomized to a treatment group, of whom 27 completed 6 months of treatment. The groups were homogeneous and comparable in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics. Five CFZ-treated patients and 1 CDP-treated patient (P = 0.15) dropped out due to development of severe lupus flare. At the end of the study, 12 CFZ-treated patients (75%) and 14 CDP-treated patients (82.4%) had complete or near-complete  remission of skin lesions; intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference in the response rates between groups. Side effects, mainly skin and gastrointestinal events, were frequent in both groups, but no patients had to discontinue their treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CFZ is equally as effective as CDP in controlling cutaneous lesions in SLE patients. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the CFZ itself could be the cause of systemic lupus flare.";2004-2006
246;Systemic lupus erythematosus in a multiethnic US Cohort (LUMINA). XXX: association between C-reactive protein (CRP) gene polymorphisms and vascular events.;2005;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Szalai AJ;OBJECTIVES: To determine if a polymorphic GTn repeat in the intron of the C-reactive protein (CRP) gene associates with occurrence of vascular arterial events in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: We performed a nested case-control study on the LUMINA cohort of 546 Hispanic, African-American and Caucasian SLE patients. Twenty-five patients who developed vascular arterial events (i.e. myocardial infarction, angina, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, stroke, claudication, gangrene or significant tissue loss and/or arterial peripheral thrombosis) after enrolment were selected as cases and 32 ethnically matched patients with no previous vascular arterial events served as controls. Their CRP gene GTn polymorphism and plasma CRP was determined. RESULTS: Patients  with vascular events had more severe SLE and were more likely to have plasma CRP  in the highest quintile of measured values. The overall distribution of GTn alleles for patients with vascular events had a greater number of the GT20 variant compared with controls [26.0% of alleles (13/50) vs 15.6% (10/64)]. This  greater number of GT20 in patients with vascular events was observed for African-Americans [29.2% (7/24) vs 21.0% (8/38)] and Hispanics [33.0% (4/12) vs 0% (0/16)] but not for Caucasians [14.3% (2/14) vs 20.0% (2/10)]. For African-Americans and Hispanics combined (45 patients), the frequency of GT20 in  those with vascular events (30.6%, 11/36) was significantly higher than in those  without them (14.8%, 8/54) (P<0.05, one-tailed test for difference in proportions). When patients were categorized according to the number of GT20 alleles they carried (thus GT20/GT20, GT20/GTx or GTx/GTx, where x is any allele  other than GT20), for both African-Americans and Hispanics the likelihood of vascular arterial events increased in proportion with the GT20 dose, and all GT20-homozygous patients developed vascular arterial events. CONCLUSIONS: The CRP GT20 variant is more likely to occur in African-American and Hispanic SLE patients than in Caucasian ones, and SLE patients carrying the GT20 allele are more likely to develop vascular arterial events. ;2004-2006
247;The effect of combined estrogen and progesterone hormone replacement therapy on disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomized trial.;2005;Annals of internal medicine;Buyon JP;"BACKGROUND: There is concern that exogenous female hormones may worsen disease activity in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on disease activity in postmenopausal women with SLE. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial conducted from March 1996 to June 2002. SETTING: 16 university-affiliated rheumatology clinics or practices in 11 U.S. states. PATIENTS: 351 menopausal patients (mean age, 50 years) with inactive (81.5%) or stable-active (18.5%) SLE. Interventions: 12 months of treatment with  active drug (0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen daily, plus 5 mg of medroxyprogesterone for 12 days per month) or placebo. The 12-month follow-up rate was 82% for the HRT group and 87% for the placebo group. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was occurrence of a severe flare as defined by Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus, National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index composite. RESULTS: Severe flare was rare in both treatment groups: The 12-month severe flare rate was 0.081 for the HRT group and 0.049 for the placebo group, yielding an estimated difference of 0.033 (P = 0.23). The upper limit of the 1-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference was 0.078, within the prespecified margin of 9% for noninferiority. Mild to moderate  flares were significantly increased in the HRT group: 1.14 flares/person-year for HRT and 0.86 flare/person-year for placebo (relative risk, 1.34; P = 0.01). The probability of any type of flare by 12 months was 0.64 for the HRT group and 0.51 for the placebo group (P = 0.01). In the HRT group, there were 1 death, 1 stroke, 2 cases of deep venous thrombosis, and 1 case of thrombosis in an arteriovenous graft; in the placebo group, 1 patient developed deep venous thrombosis. LIMITATIONS: Findings are not generalizable to women with high-titer anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, or previous thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Adding a short course of HRT is associated with a small risk for increasing the natural flare rate of lupus. Most of these flares are mild to moderate. The benefits of HRT can be balanced against the risk for flare because  HRT did not significantly increase the risk for severe flare compared with placebo.";2004-2006
248;Effects of supervised cardiovascular training program on exercise tolerance, aerobic capacity, and quality of life in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Arthritis and rheumatism;Carvalho MR;OBJECTIVE: To determine if supervised cardiovascular training improves exercise tolerance, aerobic capacity, depression, functional capacity, and quality of life in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Sixty women with SLE (ages 18-55 years) were evaluated using Short Form 36, visual analog scale for pain, scale for fatigue, Beck Depression Inventory, and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and participated in a training protocol of incremental load  on a treadmill with computed gas metabolic analysis. Maximum oxygen consumption (VO(2max)) and anaerobic threshold VO(2) were calculated with a SensorMedics Vmax29C analyzer (Sensor Medics, Yorba Linda, CA), and heart rate was measured by electrocardiogram. Patients were divided into 2 groups: a training group (41 patients) that participated in the supervised cardiovascular training program and a control group (19 patients) that did not participate in the program. All variables were analyzed at baseline and after 12 weeks for both groups. The training program occurred in the morning for 60 minutes, 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon's rank sum test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test. P values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: The 2 groups were homogeneous and comparable at baseline. The training group showed a significant improvement of aerobic capacity measured by anaerobic threshold VO(2) (14.67 +/- 3.03 versus 17.08 +/- 3.35 ml/kg/minute, P < 0.001). Comparison of the training group and control group after 12 weeks showed a significant difference relating to VO(2max) (24.31 +/- 4.61 versus 21.21 +/- 3.88 ml/kg/minute, P = 0.01) and anaerobic threshold VO(2) (17.08 +/- 3.35 versus 13.66 +/- 2.82 ml/kg/minute, P < 0.0001).  After cardiovascular training, we found a significant improvement of Beck inventory score (8.37 +/- 12.79 versus 2.90 +/- 3.00, P < 0.001) and HAQ score (0.14 +/- 0.21 versus 0.06 +/- 0.19, P < 0.01) in the training group. CONCLUSION: This study showed significant improvement in exercise tolerance, aerobic capacity, quality of life, and depression after a supervised cardiovascular training program in patients with SLE.;2004-2006
249;Study of the effect of leeching on plasma endothelin and soluble interleukin-2 receptor in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Chinese journal of integrative medicine;Cheng SP;OBJECTIVE: to explore the mechanism of leeching in treating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Forty-four patients with SLE were randomly divided  into conventional corticosteroid treated group (control group, n = 20) and conventional treatment group with leeching intervention added (leeching group, n  = 24). Before and after treatment the concentration of plasma endothelin (ET) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) were determined. RESULTS: Before treatment the level of plasma ET and sIL-2R in the SLE patients were all higher than those in the normal healthy group, (P < 0.01). But after treatment the level of these in both groups were significantly improved than those of before treatment (P < 0.05), and comparison between these two treated groups showed that the difference between them was significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Leeching added to conventional treatment of SLE could be more effective in improving the level of plasma ET and sIL-2R, and ameliorating the impairment of renal tissues.;2004-2006
250;Systemic lupus erythematosus and the extended major histocompatibility complex--evidence for several predisposing loci.;2005;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Smerdel-Ramoya A;OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease reported to be associated with several alleles in the HLA complex. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the extended HLA complex (xMHC) in order to get an overview of the primary predisposing genetic factors. Materials and METHODS: One hundred and sixty-four SLE patients and 254 healthy, unrelated controls were genotyped for HLA-DRB1, -B and -A alleles, as well as 13 microsatellites markers covering the xMHC. Moreover, we selected 335 additional controls matched with the patients for the HLA haplotypes showing the strongest associations, in order to look for additional predisposing loci. RESULTS: Two regions of the xMHC showed associations: the region covering DRB1 to B, and the extended class I region. Explicitly, DRB1*03 and B*08 displayed strong associations with SLE, which seem to be independent of each other. Furthermore, associations were seen with alleles at microsatellites D6S2225 and D6S2223, located about 3.6 Mb telomeric of HLA-B, and these were not secondary to the associations found with DRB1*03 and B*08. CONCLUSION: Both the DRB1*03 and the B*08 alleles display disease association, either implicating involvement of both  alleles or caused by another yet unidentified gene(s) in linkage disequilibrium.  The associations found in the extended class I region could be markers for a 'novel' predisposing locus (loci) in SLE, adding to the risk conferred by DRB1*03 and B*08. Interestingly, this region has been shown to also be associated with other autoimmune diseases, hence the gene(s) might confer a general propensity for autoimmunity. ;2004-2006
251;Barriers to a trial of atherosclerosis prevention in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Arthritis and rheumatism;Costenbader KH;OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of aggressive management of traditional risk factors for accelerated atherosclerosis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been advocated but not proven. We conducted a pilot, randomized, controlled trial of known prevention medications (pravastatin, ramipril, aspirin, and a combination B vitamin) plus individualized cardiovascular prevention education. We describe our experience in recruiting and retaining patients with SLE in this trial. METHODS:  Patients with SLE by American College of Rheumatology criteria who lived within 1 hour of the hospital and had visits within the past 3 years were screened. All eligible patients were contacted by the principal investigator who was not their  physician. The reasons for nonparticipation were elicited in a nonjudgmental manner. RESULTS: A total of 662 patients met the selection criteria for the study. Of these, 295 patients (45%) with contraindications to study medications were excluded. Ninety-seven (40%) of 244 eligible patients refused to participate. More than 40% of those phoned were unwilling to participate and, among those, 19% felt they were too sick, too well, or taking too many medications already. A total of 41 patients were enrolled in the trial, and 22 dropped out within 4 months. CONCLUSION: SLE is a chronic disease, and the development and testing of interventions aimed at the prevention of long-term sequelae are of paramount importance. Prevention trials in SLE face serious challenges, including the recruitment and retention of participants. Our experience provides insights into the barriers to participation in randomized prevention trials in SLE.;2004-2006
252;Cognitive dysfunction in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences;Emori A;"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune-mediated collagen disease that results in multiorgan failure. It is the collagen disease most frequently associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, which have been hypothesized to stem from certain types of cognitive dysfunction. Subjects were 21 patients with SLE (one man, 20 women; aged 16-55 years; mean age, 35.1+/-10.7 years) who were undergoing treatment in the rheumatology unit of a general hospital, and 17 healthy control subjects matched to the patient group with respect to age and gender (two men, 15 women; mean age, 35.9+/-6.3 years). They were administered various tests of cognitive function including verbal reasoning, non-verbal reasoning, verbal memory, non-verbal memory, attention and mental flexibility, psychomotor speed and frontal lobe function. In addition, the SLE patients were tested for antiphospholipid antibodies. The SLE patients performed worse than the control group on immediate, delayed and interference of the Rey verbal test and paired associate tests of Wechsler Memory Scale, and their reaction time was slower in Trail A and Trail B tests. Moreover, these findings were more pronounced in the group with major neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, no relationship was apparent between these deficits in cognitive function and the presence or absence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The results suggest that verbal memory and psychomotor speed underlie the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in SLE patients.";2004-2006
253;Changes in the survival of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in childhood: 30 years experience in Chile.;2005;Lupus;Gonzalez B;The objective of this study was to analyse the survival rate and cause of death in children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) during the past 30 years in Chile. A retrospective analysis was performed between 1969 and 2000 on patients attending pediatric rheumatology centres in Santiago, Chile. Survival and causes  of death in 31 children followed from 1969 to 1980 fulfilling the 1982 American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE and treated with oral steroids were compared with 50 other patients who were treated with oral steroids and an aggressive treatment of IV bolus of cyclophosphamide (38 patients) and azathioprine (12 patients). Global survival at five and 10 years follow-up for the patients studied from 1969 to 1980 was 68 and 40%, respectively. During the second study period these values were significantly improved and global survival  reached 95% at five years and 90% at 10 years follow-up (P < 0.05). Survival at 10 years follow-up for patients with lupus nephropathy increased from 28% (study  period 1964-1980) to 86% (study period 1984-2000). Twelve children died (38%) during the 1964-1980 study period. The causes of death were six due to kidney failure, three due to infectious conditions and another three of unknown causes.  During the 1980-2000 study period mortality reached 6% (three cases), two cases died of a lupus flare-up and one case due to infection. In the last three decades, we have seen an important increase in the survival of children with SLE, especially in those patients with renal involvement. Management with immunosuppressive drugs, such as IV cyclophosphamide or azathioprine has changed  the prognosis in these children. These results demonstrate that our children with SLE increased their life expectancy but are now faced with new types of morbidity because of the sequelae related to the disease itself.;2004-2006
254;Systemic lupus erythematosus in a multiethnic cohort (LUMINA): XXVIII. Factors predictive of thrombotic events.;2005;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Ho KT;"OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between the presence of antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies, hydroxychloroquine use and the occurrence of thrombotic events  in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: Four hundred and forty-two SLE patients from the LUMINA (Lupus in Minorities: Nature vs Nurture) cohort, a multiethnic (Hispanics from Texas, n = 99 and Puerto Rico, n = 36; African Americans, n = 172; and Caucasians, n = 135) cohort, were studied by generalized estimating equation (GEE) to determine the relationship between antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies (measured as IgG and IgM aPL antibodies and/or  the lupus anticoagulant) at enrolment or historically prior to enrolment, hydroxychloroquine use (ever) and the occurrence of thrombotic (central and/or peripheral, arterial and/or venous) events after adjusting for known and possible confounders [socioeconomic-demographic features, smoking, disease activity and damage, serum cholesterol levels, anti-oxidized low-density lipoprotein IgG and IgM antibodies, and high-sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein]. Postanalysis correlation between aPL and anticardiolipin (aCL) assays was attempted by performing aCL assays on random samples of patients whose aPL status was known. RESULTS: A number of clinical variables were significant in the univariable analyses; however, in the multivariable GEE analyses, only smoking [odds ratio (OR) 2.777, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.317-5.852] and disease activity as measured by the SLAM (Systemic Lupus Activity Measure) (OR 1.099; 95% CI 1.053-1.147) were significant. In particular, hydroxychloroquine use, which appeared to be protective against thrombotic events in the univariable analyses,  was not retained in the multivariable analyses. aPL antibodies were not significant in either analysis. Few additional aPL-positive patients emerged from the validation study. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking and disease activity emerged as important determinants in the occurrence of thrombotic events in our patients. Comprehensive treatment strategies should be directed to both smoking cessation and control of disease activity in patients with SLE.";2004-2006
255;BILAG 2004. Development and initial validation of an updated version of the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group's disease activity index for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Isenberg DA;OBJECTIVE: To devise a more discriminating version of the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) disease activity index and to show that it is reliable.  METHODS: A nominal consensus approach was undertaken by members of BILAG to update and improve the BILAG lupus disease activity index. The index has been revised following intense consultations over a 1-yr period. It has been assessed  in two real-patient exercises. These involved patients with diverse clinical features of SLE, including gastrointestinal, hepatic and ophthalmic problems, which the earlier versions of the index did not fully take into account. Reliability in terms of the ability to differentiate patients was assessed by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients. The level of agreement between physicians was determined by calculating the ratio of estimates of the standard error (SE) attributable to the physicians to the SE attributable to the patients. RESULTS: Good reliability and high levels of physician agreement were observed in one or both exercises in the constitutional, mucocutaneous, neurological, cardiorespiratory, renal, ophthalmic and haematological systems. In contrast, the musculoskeletal system did not score as well, although providing more clear-cut glossary definitions should greatly improve the situation. CONCLUSIONS: Some significant changes in the BILAG disease activity index to assess patients with SLE are proposed. The process of demonstrating validity and reliability has started with these two exercises assessing real patients. Further validation studies are under way. BILAG 2004 is likely to be valuable in clinical trials assessing new therapies for the treatment of SLE, as it provides a more comprehensive system-based disease activity measure than has been available previously.;2004-2006
256;Oestrogen receptor {alpha} gene polymorphisms in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Johansson M;OBJECTIVE: To analyse associations of two oestrogen receptor alpha (ORalpha) gene polymorphisms in 260 patients with SLE from northern Sweden. The two polymorphisms, PvuII T/C and the XbaI A/G, are located in the first intron of the ORalpha gene. METHODS: All patients fulfilling at least four of the ACR criteria  for SLE were consecutively recruited during one year. The SLEDAI score and SLICC  damage index were recorded. 670 individuals from the same geographical area served as controls. DNA from the patients and controls was extracted and genotyped using the 5' nuclease assay with an ABI PRISM 7900HT instrument. The genotype/phenotype relationships were calculated using SPSS. RESULTS: The unusual PvuII C allele was associated with malar rash and the unusual XbaI G allele with  photosensitivity (p = 0.001, OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.43 to 4.47 and p = 0.007, OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.22 to 3.66, respectively). The common XbaI AA genotype was associated with serositis (p = 0.013, OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.15 to 3.22). Based on the SLICC damage index associations of the common TT genotype and AA genotype with cognitive impairment were identified (p = 0.018, OR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.17 to 5.25 and p = 0.018, OR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.19 to 6.38 respectively). There was also an association of the XbaI AA genotype with the angina/coronary artery bypass variable (p = 0.042, OR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.03 to 6.43). Of the variables describing disease severity and duration it was found that carriers of the unusual PvuII C allele showed a later onset of SLE (p = 0.02) and carriers of the unusual XbaI G allele a lower SLICC damage index. CONCLUSIONS: The unusual PvuII  C and XbaI G alleles were associated with a milder form of SLE characterised by skin manifestations, later onset, and less organ damage.

257;B-cell depletion in the treatment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus:  a longitudinal analysis of 24 patients.;2005;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Leandro MJ;OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical and basic serological consequences of B-cell depletion with rituximab in the treatment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who have failed conventional immunosuppression. METHODS: An open study of 24 patients with severe SLE followed for a minimum of 3 months is reported. In the majority of patients (19 out of 24), 6 months follow-up data are described. Disease activity in these patients was assessed every 1-2 months using the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) system and estimates of anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies and serum C3 levels. During the follow-up period, significant side-effects were sought and the reduction in oral prednisolone was recorded. It was our general practice to stop concomitant immunosuppression (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate) when B-cell depletion was given (in most cases in the form of two 1 g intravenous infusions of rituximab 2  weeks apart accompanied by two 750 mg intravenous cyclophosphamide infusions and  two methylprednisolone infusions of 250 mg each). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were female and two male. At the time of B-cell depletion, the mean age was 28.9  yr (range 17-49) and the mean disease duration was 7.9 yr (range 1-18). The global BILAG score (P < 0.00001), serum C3 (P < 0.0005) and double-stranded DNA binding (P < 0.002) all improved from the time of B-cell depletion to 6 months after this treatment. Only one patient failed to achieve B-lymphocyte depletion in the peripheral blood. The period of B-lymphocyte depletion ranged from 3 to 8  months except for one patient who remains depleted at more than 4 yr. Analysis of the regular BILAG assessments showed that improvements occurred in each of the eight organs or systems. The mean daily prednisolone dose fell from 13.8 mg (s.d. 11.3) to 10 mg (s.d. 3.1). CONCLUSION: In this open study of patients who had failed conventional immunosuppressive therapy, considerable utility in the use of B-cell depletion has been demonstrated. Our data provide strong support for the performance of a full double-blind control trial.;2004-2006
258;T cell vaccination in systemic lupus erythematosus with autologous activated T cells.;2005;Lupus;Li ZG;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoreactive T cell mediated autoimmune  disease. Immunization with inactivated autoreactive T cells may induce idiotype anti-idiotypic reaction to deplete specific subsets of autoreactive T cells involved in SLE. Six SLE patients unsuitable or refused to use immunosuppressants were treated with T cell vaccination. Their clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters including mixed lymphocyte reactions were evaluated. Autoreactive T cell clones were derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the patients and 1 X 10(7) irradiated T cells were inoculated subcutaneously at 0, two, six and eight weeks, respectively. The enrolled patients were followed up for 32-40 months at an interval of three to six months. The clinical characteristics and laboratory abnormalities improved after inoculation without increasing the dose of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants in most patients. SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) scores decreased. Proliferative responses against the T cell vaccine were observed in four of six patients. At the time of  this report, the six patients remain in clinical remission. No significant side effect from the vaccination was noticed during the follow-up period. The results  of this pilot study indicate that T cell vaccination is a safe and effective treatment in SLE.;2004-2006
259;Relationship between anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies and exacerbation of renal disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Arthritis and rheumatism;Linnik MD;"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between changes in anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels and the risk of renal flare in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), using data from 2 randomized, controlled trials. METHODS: Analyses were based on 487 patients with SLE and a history of lupus nephritis who had an anti-dsDNA antibody titer >/=15 IU/ml at baseline, as  measured by Farr assay. Results are presented for the combined population of patients, the placebo arms, and the drug treatment arms in which a dsDNA-based bioconjugate (abetimus sodium; LJP 394) was used. RESULTS: Changes in anti-dsDNA  antibody levels were inversely correlated with changes in the C3 level (P < 0.0001 in both trials). Cox proportional hazards regression models showed that changes in anti-dsDNA antibody levels correlated with the risk of renal flare. The models predicted that a point estimate of a 50% reduction in anti-dsDNA antibody levels is associated with a 52% reduction (95% confidence interval [95%  CI] 26-68%, nominal P = 0.0007) and a 53% reduction (95% CI 33-69%, nominal P < 0.0001) in the risk of renal flare in the 2 trials, respectively. In the 2 trials, the incidence of renal flare was lower in patients with sustained reductions in anti-dsDNA antibodies (3.0% and 4.1%, respectively) than in patients with stable or increasing antibody levels (21.3% and 20.3%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Changes in anti-dsDNA antibody levels were directly correlated with the risk of renal flare and inversely correlated with changes in  the C3 level. Reducing anti-dsDNA antibody levels may represent a therapeutic objective in SLE patients with lupus nephritis, because it is associated with a reduced risk of renal flare.";2004-2006

261;Effects of prasterone on bone mineral density in women with systemic lupus erythematosus receiving chronic glucocorticoid therapy.;2005;The Journal of rheumatology;Mease PJ;OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of treatment with prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone) on bone mineral density (BMD) in female patients with mild to moderate systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) receiving chronic treatment with glucocorticoids. METHODS: Fifty-five female patients with SLE who had received prednisone (or glucocorticoid equivalent) </= 10 mg/day for >/= 6 months were treated for 1 year with either prasterone 200 mg/day (n = 24) or placebo (n  = 31) in this randomized, double blind trial. Prasterone or placebo was added to  each patient's one or more concomitant standard SLE medications, including glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antimalarials, methotrexate, azathioprine, and other immunosuppressives, which were to be maintained at fixed doses for the duration of the study. RESULTS: BMD was significantly improved in patients who received prasterone compared to placebo. At the lumbar spine, there was a mean (SEM) gain in BMD of 1.7 +/- 0.8% in the prasterone group compared to a mean loss in BMD of -1.1 +/- 0.5% in the placebo group (p = 0.003 between groups). For the total hip, mean gain was 2.0 +/- 0.9% in the prasterone group vs a mean loss of -0.3 +/- 0.4% in the placebo group (p = 0.013 between groups). In the prasterone treatment group, the mean gains from baseline at both lumbar spine and hip were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Prasterone treatment prevented BMD loss and significantly increased BMD at both the lumbar spine and total hip in female patients with SLE receiving exogenous glucocorticoids.;2004-2006
262;Raloxifene for postmenopausal women with systemic lupus erythematosus: a pilot randomized controlled study.;2005;Arthritis and rheumatism;Mok CC;"OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of raloxifene on disease activity and bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Postmenopausal women with osteopenia and inactive SLE were randomly assigned to receive either raloxifene (60 mg/day) plus elemental calcium (1,200 mg/day) or elemental calcium alone (control). Patients with a history of thromboembolism or antiphospholipid antibody positivity were excluded. BMD at various sites was serially measured, and lupus activity was serially assessed using the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus: National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI). RESULTS: The study group comprised 33 patients (16 assigned to receive raloxifene and 17 controls, mean +/- SD age 53.8 +/- 5.3 years). Age, body mass index, and baseline BMD values did not differ significantly between the 2 groups of patients. All patients were receiving low-dose prednisolone. After 12 months, femoral neck BMD (mean +/- SD -2.6 +/- 1.0%; P = 0.02) and lumbar spine BMD (-3.3 +/- 0.8%; P = 0.001) decreased significantly in the controls but not in the raloxifene group. No patient had a major flare of lupus, but mild/moderate flares occurred in 4 raloxifene-treated and 6 control patients (P = 0.79). The total area under the curve of SELENA-SLEDAI scores was not significantly different between the 2 groups. A significant increase in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and a reduction in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level were observed in the raloxifene group but not in controls. One patient in the raloxifene group (6%) withdrew from the study because of hot flushes. No thromboembolic events were reported. CONCLUSION: Raloxifene was well tolerated in Chinese patients with SLE who had inactive disease and in whom hypercoagulability was not identified. Raloxifene maintained femoral neck and spinal BMD in patients receiving corticosteroids.";2004-2006

264;Effects of dehydroepiandrosterone supplement on health-related quality of life in glucocorticoid treated female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Autoimmunity;Nordmark G;"The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of low dose dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in glucocorticoid treated female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Forty one women ( >or= 5 mg prednisolone/day) were included in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study for 6 months where DHEA was given at 30 mg/20 mg ( <or= 45/ >or= 46 years) daily, or placebo, followed by 6 months open DHEA treatment to all patients. HRQOL was assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months,  using four validated questionnaires and the patients' partners completed a questionnaire assessing mood and behaviour at 6 months. DHEA treatment increased  serum levels of sulphated DHEA from subnormal to normal. The DHEA group improved  in SF-36 ""role emotional"" and HSCL-56 total score (both p<0.05). During open DHEA treatment, the former placebo group improved in SF-36 ""mental health"" (p<0.05) with a tendency for improvement in HSCL-56 total score (p=0.10). Both groups improved in McCoy's Sex Scale during active treatment (p<0.05). DHEA replacement  decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and increased insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and haematocrit. There were no effects on bone density or disease activity and no serious adverse events. Side effects were mild. We conclude that low dose DHEA treatment improves HRQOL with regard to mental well-being and sexuality and can be offered to women with SLE where mental distress and/or impaired sexuality constitutes a problem.";2004-2006
265;The systemic lupus erythematosus tri-nation study: longitudinal changes in physical and mental well-being.;2005;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Panopalis P;"OBJECTIVE: We have shown that SLE patients in Canada and the UK incurred 20% and  13% lower health costs than those in the US, respectively, but did not experience worse outcomes as expressed by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index. We now compare change in quality of life in these patients. Patients and METHODS: Seven hundred and fifteen SLE patients (Canada 231, US 269, UK 215) completed the SF-36 annually over four years. The annual change in the SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary (PCS and MCS) scores over the course of the study were summarized by estimating a linear trend for each individual patient using hierarchical modelling. Cross-country comparison of the slopes in the PCS and MCS scores was then performed using simultaneous regressions. RESULTS: The estimated mean annual changes (95% credible interval [CrI]) in the PCS scores in Canada, the US, and the UK were 0.18 (-0.07, 0.43), -0.05 (-0.27, 0.17), and 0.03 (-0.20, 0.27), respectively; the mean annual changes in the MCS scores were 0.15 (-0.04, 0.34),  0.23 (0.09, 0.37), and 0.08 (-0.10, 0.27), respectively. Regression results showed that the mean annual changes in PCS and MCS scores did not substantially differ across countries. CONCLUSION: Quality of life remained stable across countries. Despite Canadian and British patients incurring lower health costs, on average, patients experienced similar changes in physical and mental well-being.

266;Combined oral contraceptives in women with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;The New England journal of medicine;Petri M;"BACKGROUND: Oral contraceptives are rarely prescribed for women with systemic lupus erythematosus, because of concern about potential negative side effects. In this double-blind, randomized, noninferiority trial, we prospectively evaluated the effect of oral contraceptives on lupus activity in premenopausal women with systemic lupus erythematosus. METHODS: A total of 183 women with inactive (76 percent) or stable active (24 percent) systemic lupus erythematosus at 15 U.S. sites were randomly assigned to receive either oral contraceptives (triphasic ethinyl estradiol at a dose of 35 microg plus norethindrone at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg for 12 cycles of 28 days each; 91 women) or placebo (92 women) and were evaluated at months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Subjects were excluded if they had moderate or high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, or a  history of thrombosis. RESULTS: The primary end point, a severe lupus flare, occurred in 7 of 91 subjects receiving oral contraceptives (7.7 percent) as compared with 7 of 92 subjects receiving placebo (7.6 percent). The 12-month rates of severe flare were similar: 0.084 for the group receiving oral contraceptives and 0.087 for the placebo group (P=0.95; upper limit of the one-sided 95 percent confidence interval for this difference, 0.069, which is within the prespecified 9 percent margin for noninferiority). Rates of mild or moderate flares were 1.40 flares per person-year for subjects receiving oral contraceptives and 1.44 flares per person-year for subjects receiving placebo (relative risk, 0.98; P=0.86). In the group that was randomized to receive oral contraceptives, there was one deep venous thrombosis and one clotted graft; in the placebo group, there was one deep venous thrombosis, one ocular thrombosis, one superficial thrombophlebitis, and one death (after cessation of the trial). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that oral contraceptives do not increase the risk of flare among women with systemic lupus erythematosus whose disease is stable.";2004-2006
267;Activity of systemic lupus erythematosus in end-stage renal disease patients: study in a Brazilian cohort.;2005;American journal of nephrology;Ribeiro FM;"BACKGROUND: Dialysis has been associated with lupus remission. We studied the prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as a cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro and assessed disease activity in SLE patients on dialysis. METHODS: Of 3,535 ESRD patients, 63 had SLE (1.8%). Fifty-seven entered the study (54 females, 3 males, 38 +/- 10 years). Hemodialysis consisted of 3 sessions per week of about 4 h duration, blood flow of about 400 ml/min, bicarbonate dialysate ([Ca(2+)] = 2.5-3.5 mEq/l) at 500 ml/min and cellulose acetate or polysulfone dialyzers. Activity was initially defined as: non-renal (nr) SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) of >0; use of at least 20 mg/day of prednisone; and/or any dose of another activity-controlling drug. Fifty-seven ESRD patients without SLE were used as controls. RESULTS: Eighteen SLE patients were under drug treatment; of the remaining, 30 had an nrSLEDAI of >0 totaling 48 patients (84%) initially labeled as active. An apparent activity was also present in 21 controls (37%). Of those, 19 had an nrSLEDAI of <4. With a cutoff of >or=4, figures in each group would be 49 and 4%. Under this criterion, age was the only significant predictor of flare in our SLE  ESRD population in a multivariate logistic regression model. Activity remained high in patients who were on dialysis for >5 years (7/18, 39%). CONCLUSION: SLE accounted for 1.8% of our ESRD patients. Application of SLEDAI to dialysis patients may require consideration of confounding factors related to the ESRD state. Even with a score of >or=4 as a cutoff, SLE activity in dialysis patients  was high (49%) and long-lasting. Age was the major determinant of flare.";2004-2006
268;Anti-DNA antibodies: a diagnostic and prognostic tool for systemic lupus erythematosus?;2005;Autoimmunity;Riboldi P;The clinical impact of anti-DNA antibodies lies on their diagnostic power for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), being a formal classification criterion. In spite of such a disease association, low-avidity anti-DNA antibodies might also be part of the natural autoantibody repertoire. Their switch to pathogenic high-avidity autoantibodies is the result of the autoimmune process leading to SLE.Anti-DNA antibodies were shown to play a role in SLE pathogenesis and particularly in kidney damage. Accordingly, antibody titres might fluctuate in relation to disease activity, but their prognostic value for flares is still debated.Several methods for anti-DNA detection were described and there is evidence that the assays identify different antibodies with different prognostic  value. The results of a multicenter study on four different routine tests for anti-dsDNA antibody detection showed that: (i) Farr assay displays the best diagnostic specificity/sensitivity for SLE, followed by Crithidia luciliae method (CLIFT), (ii) the new generation of solid phase assay (EliA) shows an increased sensibility versus the classical enzyme linked immune assay (ELISA) but a decreased specificity. Antibody titre detected by EliA and Farr assay correlated  with disease activity. These findings would suggest that more than one assay should be useful for SLE diagnosis and monitoring.;2004-2006
269;Valvular heart disease as a cause of cerebrovascular disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;The American journal of cardiology;Roldan CA;Thirty-seven patients with systemic lupus erythematosus underwent complete clinical and laboratory evaluations, including antiphospholipid antibodies and lupus anticoagulant, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and transesophageal echocardiography. Cerebrovascular disease manifested as stroke, transient ischemic attack, or cerebral infarcts in patients with nonfocal neurologic deficits was detected in 19 patients (51%), and significant left-sided valvular heart disease in 25 (68%). Valve vegetations, valve thickening, valve regurgitation, and lupus anticoagulant antibody occurred 2 to 3 times more often  in patients with than without cerebrovascular disease (all p < or =0.04) and were the only independent predictors of cerebrovascular disease (odd ratios 5.3 to 10.6, all p < or =0.03). Thus, valvular heart disease probably exacerbated by hypercoagulability appears to be a source of embolic ischemic brain injury and cerebrovascular disease.;2004-2006
270;Clinical significance of fever in the systemic lupus erythematosus patient receiving steroid therapy.;2005;Kidney international;Rovin BH;"BACKGROUND: Active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can cause fever. Steroids (glucocorticoids) suppress SLE fever; however, the extent to which steroid therapy affects SLE fever not previously been rigorously studied. METHODS: Study  A is a prospective study of recurrently active SLE patients (N= 92, 60 renal SLE  and 32 nonrenal SLE) who recorded daily oral evening temperatures while participating in a longitudinal study of risk factors for SLE flare. Study B is a retrospective study of consecutive febrile SLE patients (N= 22) who received steroids initially because SLE was suspected. At final analysis 11 had SLE fever  and 11 had infection fever. RESULTS: In study A during a mean follow-up of 13.2 +/- 8.1 months, 51 of the 92 patients experienced 73 SLE flares. In only one patient was SLE fever associated with SLE flare. In the other 50 patients who flared, there was no significant trend to develop fever prior to or at the onset  of SLE flare. Prednisone, median dose 10 mg, was being received at 82% of the study visits at which an SLE flare was declared. In study B, prednisone 28 mg (range 20 to 40 mg) completely suppressed SLE fever, usually within 24 hours. In  contrast, infection fever persisted despite prednisone 35 to 300 mg/day. Of those with infection fever, three developed fatal sepsis when high-dose steroid therapy was continued. CONCLUSION: In SLE patients receiving prednisone at maintenance doses or greater, SLE fever is rare. When fever does develop, it is usually due to infection. Continuing high steroid dose steroid therapy in those with infection fever may increase the risk of severe sepsis.";2004-2006
271;Interleukin 12 (IL12B), interleukin 12 receptor (IL12RB1) and interleukin 23 (IL23A) gene polymorphism in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Sanchez E;OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the possible association between the interleukin-12B (IL12B) and interleukin-12 receptor beta 1 (IL12RB1) gene polymorphisms with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, we have undertaken a systematic search for genetic variants of interleukin 23 (IL23A). METHODS: The study was conducted on 559 SLE patients and 603 ethnically matched healthy controls. Genotyping of the IL12B [IL12Bpro and IL12B 3' untranslated region (UTR)] and IL12RB1 (641A-->G, 1094T-->C and 1132G-->C) polymorphisms was performed with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and PCR-fluorescent methods, whereas IL23A genetic variants were realized with direct sequencing. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in the distribution of the IL12B and the IL12RB1 genotypes and alleles were observed when comparing SLE patients and control subjects. Additionally, no differences in the genotype and allele distribution were found when SLE patients were stratified according to the presence or absence of lupus nephritis. Despite an extensive analysis in 30 individuals, variations located in the exons and in the 5' and 3' UTR regions of IL23A gene were not found in any case. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that polymorphisms located in IL12B, IL12RB1 and IL23A genes may not play a relevant role in the susceptibility or severity of SLE in the Spanish population.

272;A trial of contraceptive methods in women with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;The New England journal of medicine;Sanchez-Guerrero J;BACKGROUND: The effects of estrogen-containing contraceptives on disease activity in women with systemic lupus erythematosus have not been determined. METHODS: We  conducted a single-blind clinical trial involving 162 women with systemic lupus erythematosus who were randomly assigned to combined oral contraceptives, a progestin-only pill, or a copper intrauterine device (IUD). Disease activity was  assessed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months according to the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). The primary outcome was global disease activity, which we estimated by measuring the area under the SLEDAI curve. Secondary outcomes included the maximum SLEDAI score, change in SLEDAI score, incidence of lupus flares, median time to first flare, systemic lupus erythematosus treatment, and adverse events. The results were analyzed by the intention-to-treat method. RESULTS: At baseline, all demographic features and disease characteristics were similar in the three groups. The mean (+/-SD) SLEDAI score was 6.1+/-5.6 in the group assigned to combined oral contraceptives, 6.4+/-4.6 in the group assigned to the progestin-only pill, and 5.0+/-5.3 in the  group assigned to the IUD (54 patients in each group) (P=0.36). Disease activity  remained mild and stable in all groups throughout the trial. There were no significant differences among the groups during the trial in global or maximum disease activity, incidence or probability of flares, or medication use. The median time to the first flare was three months in all groups. Thromboses occurred in four patients (two in each of the two groups receiving hormones), and severe infections were more frequent in the IUD group. One patient receiving combined oral contraceptives died from amoxicillin-related severe neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: Global disease activity, maximum SLEDAI score, incidence of flares,  time to first flare, and incidence of adverse events were similar among women with systemic lupus erythematosus, irrespective of the type of contraceptive they were using.;2004-2006
273;Glucocorticosteroid therapy decreases CD14-expression and CD14-mediated LPS-binding and activation of monocytes in patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus.;2005;Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.);Sumegi A;In order to study the possible action of glucocorticosteroids (GCS) on the CD14/Toll like receptor mediated activation of monocytes the CD14-expression, CD14-mediated LPS binding and activation of these cells of patients suffering from Systemic Lupus Erythematosus receiving no, low dose or pulse steroid treatment was studied. The CD14-expression was determined on whole blood monocytes by flow cytometry, while the LPS-binding of an FITC-LPS preparate and the LPS-induced TNFalpha secretion were tested on isolated monocytes. The CD14-dependent and -independent LPS-binding and activation were evaluated with the help of a blocking anti-CD14 mAb. Our results showed that the CD14-expression, CD14-dependent LPS-binding and activation were significantly inhibited by the in vivo applied pulse steroid therapy. In contrast, the CD14-independent LPS-binding and activation were not altered by the GCS treatment. Our data provide further in vivo evidence for a possible new way of GCS therapy is able to initiate its anti-inflammatory action.;2004-2006
274;Effects of vitamins C and E on oxidative stress markers and endothelial function  in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a double blind, placebo controlled pilot study.;2005;The Journal of rheumatology;Tam LS;OBJECTIVE: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) experience excess morbidity and mortality due to coronary artery disease (CAD) that cannot be fully explained by the classical CAD risk factors. Among emerging CAD risk factors, oxidative stress is currently being emphasized. We evaluated the effects of longterm antioxidant vitamins on markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense and endothelial function in 39 patients with SLE. METHODS: Patients were  randomized to receive either placebo or vitamins (500 mg vitamin C and 800 IU vitamin E daily) for 12 weeks. Markers of oxidative stress included malondialdehyde (MDA) and allantoin. Antioxidants measured included erythrocyte superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, plasma total antioxidant power (as FRAP value), and ascorbic acid and vitamin E concentrations. Endothelial function was assessed by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery and plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). Primary outcome of the study included the change in lipid peroxidation as revealed by MDA levels. Secondary outcomes included changes in allantoin and antioxidant levels and change in endothelial function. RESULTS:  After treatment, plasma ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) increased only in the vitamin-treated group, associated  with a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in plasma MDA. Other oxidative stress markers and antioxidant levels remained unchanged in both groups. FMD and vWF and PAI-1 levels remained unchanged in both groups. CONCLUSION: Combined administration of vitamins C and E was associated with decreased lipid peroxidation, but did not affect endothelial function in patients with SLE after  3 months of therapy.;2004-2006
275;Systemic lupus erythematosus in a multiethnic cohort (LUMINA): XXIX. Elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate is associated with disease activity and damage accrual.;2005;The Journal of rheumatology;Vila LM;"OBJECTIVE: To determine if different categories of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) elevation are associated with disease activity and/or damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: We studied 2317 study visits in 553 SLE patients (> or = 4 American College of Rheumatology criteria, < or = 5 years' disease duration at enrollment) from a multiethnic (Hispanic, African American, and Caucasian) longitudinal study of outcome. A study visit was done every 6 months for the first year and annually thereafter. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was measured using the Westergren method; results were expressed in 4 categories: < 25 (normal), 25-50 (mild elevation), 51-75 (moderate elevation), and > 75 (marked elevation) mm/h. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were measured at enrollment with the Crithidia luciliae assay. Disease activity was assessed with  the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM) and the Physician's Global Assessment  (PGA). Because ESR is one of the measures evaluated in the SLAM, it was excluded  from the total SLAM score. Disease damage was assessed with the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics damage index (SDI). The relationship between  the SLAM (total and PGA) and SDI scores (at baseline and for all visits) and anti-dsDNA antibodies (at enrollment) with ESR was examined by univariable and generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression analyses. Ethnicity, age, and sex were entered in all regression models. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 89.7% women with mean age 36.8 (SD 12.6) years and disease duration 4.6 (SD 3.2) years. GEE analyses showed that increasing levels of ESR and anti-dsDNA antibody positivity were independently associated with SLAM and PGA scores, at enrollment  and for all visits. Overall, the associations of ESR with SLAM and PGA scores were stronger than for the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies. At baseline, there  was no relationship of ESR elevation or anti-dsDNA positivity with SDI scores. However, when all visits were studied, moderate and marked elevations of ESR were independently associated with SDI scores. CONCLUSION: Mild, moderate, and marked  ESR elevations are strongly associated with disease activity in SLE. Moderate and marked ESR elevations are also associated with damage accrual. These associations are stronger than those for the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies. Our data suggest that ESR could be used to assess disease activity and predict organ/system damage in a relatively rapid and inexpensive manner in SLE.";2004-2006
276;Survival of patients with SLE admitted to an intensive care unit-a retrospective  study.;2005;Clinical rheumatology;Whitelaw DA;We examined the demography, reasons for admission and cause of death in systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) over a 7-year period. Fourteen patients were admitted during this period-all were female, 13 were of mixed ethnic ancestry and one a black South African. Of the 14 patients, 12 were admitted as a result of lupus activity, 2 had sepsis as the major cause of admission, although 5 other patients developed infection during their admission. Five patients had a generalised flare of their  disease or progressive renal failure. Seven patients were admitted with a variety of lupus-related pathologies. In general the precise cause of death was difficult to determine. Of the 14 patients, 9 had impaired renal function on admission including 1 with sepsis and 1 of the survivors. Three patients (21%) survived, one with respiratory failure due to shrinking lung, a second with an acute flare  of SLE and a third with pulmonary emboli. This study demonstrates that lupus in our community may produce life-threatening flares. Although cause of death was not always definitely identified, admission to the ICU was primarily due to active SLE and not sepsis or iatrogenic disease.;2004-2006
277;Anti-serum amyloid component P antibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus correlate with disease activity.;2005;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Zandman-Goddard G;OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of raised titres of anti-serum amyloid P component (SAP) antibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to evaluate their correlation with clinical disease by the SLEDAI and clinical manifestations. METHODS: 452 samples were screened for raised anti-SAP antibody titres by an ELISA. Clinical measures and SLEDAI scores were independently reviewed from medical records. 21 serial samples from 7 patients with SLE were assessed for a change in anti-SAP antibody titres after treatment.  RESULTS: Raised anti-SAP antibody titres were detected in 145/328 (44%) SLE samples. In 112 randomly selected samples, 69/112 (62%) patients had raised anti-SAP antibodies and anti-dsDNA antibody titres, whereas only 32/112 (28%) had raised anti-dsDNA antibody titres without raised anti-SAP antibody titres. The mean titre of anti-SAP antibodies in patients with active disease was higher than in patients with inactive disease and controls. SLEDAI scores, assessed in 54 patients, were raised in 26/31 (84%) patients with raised anti-SAP antibody titres. A SLEDAI score >or=8 was found in 16/31 (52%) patients with raised anti-SAP antibody titres but in only 5/23 (22%) patients without raised titres. No specific pattern of disease was detected in patients with or without raised titres of anti-SAP antibodies. Serial sampling from patients with active SLE and  raised anti-SAP antibody titres showed that anti-SAP antibody titres decreased after treatment and correlated with clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Raised anti-SAP antibody titres detected in patients with SLE correlate with disease activity and decrease with improvement of clinical disease, and thus may serve as an additional prognostic marker.;2004-2006
278;Diagnostic value of single-photon-emission computed tomography in severe central  nervous system involvement of systemic lupus erythematosus: a case-control study.;2005;Arthritis and rheumatism;Zhang X;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) in severe central nervous system (CNS) involvement of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Forty-three patients with SLE, including 22 with CNS-SLE and 21 with non-CNS-SLE, underwent SPECT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. SPECT was repeated 1-2 months after treatment in patients with abnormal findings. RESULTS: SPECT and MRI abnormalities were detected in 20 (90.9%) and 10 (45.5%) of the 22 patients with CNS-SLE, respectively (P < 0.01). For 4 patients with cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, SPECT was equally as sensitive as MRI (100%). For the patients with CNS-SLE with  diffuse presentations, SPECT was more sensitive than MRI in revealing abnormalities (16 [88.9%] of 18 patients versus 6 [33.3%] of 18 patients; P < 0.01). In 19 (95.0%) patients, the abnormal SPECT finding manifested as moderate  to severe perfusion defect (15 in frontal lobe, 11 in parietal lobe, 11 in basal  ganglia, 3 in temporal lobe, and 17 in multiple regions). Although mild perfusion defect was also detected in 4 (19.0%) of the patients with non-CNS-SLE, it only involved a single region and spared the frontal and parietal lobes. Repeated SPECT after treatment showed that perfusion defect had improved significantly or  even disappeared in 11 (84.6%) of 13 patients with diffuse CNS-SLE with abnormal  findings before treatment. CONCLUSION: Moderate to severe perfusion defect in SPECT involving multiple regions, especially in the frontal and parietal lobes and basal ganglia, in patients with lupus suggests CNS involvement. SPECT is more sensitive than MRI in revealing damage in diffuse CNS-SLE, and is useful in followup, especially for monitoring disease severity and guiding treatment.";2004-2006
279;Cyclophosphamide boluses induce micronuclei expression in buccal mucosa cells of  patients with systemic lupus erythematosus independent of cytochrome P450 2D6 status.;2004;The Journal of rheumatology;Aceves Avila FJ;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of cyclophosphamide (CYC) and the influence of CYP2D6 polymorphism on micronuclei expression in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Micronuclei (MN) assays were performed in oral mucosa sweeps of 49 patients with SLE, receiving and not receiving CYC therapy, and 43 healthy controls. In patients receiving CYC the MN assay was repeated 14 days after CYC administration. SLE patients underwent determination of the CYP2D6 allele expressed in peripheral blood by polymerase chain reaction amplification.  These results were compared with CYP2D6 distribution in a healthy population from the same geographic area. The results were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with SLE received CYC boluses. The mean age of SLE patients was 32 +/- 10 years; mean disease duration was 7 +/- 6 years. Basal expression of MN was similar in the groups investigated and increased significantly in those exposed to CYC (CYC group 44%, no CYC group 5%,  healthy controls 9%; p = 0.001). We found no association between the CYP2D6 allele expressed and MN induction. Poor metabolizers were overrepresented in SLE  subjects as compared with 139 healthy controls (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Genotoxicity, as assessed by the MN assay, is increased in patients with SLE after CYC boluses. The CYP2D6 allele expressed in SLE patients does not have a role in CYC induced chromosomal injury.";2004-2006
280;Rituximab improves peripheral B cell abnormalities in human systemic lupus erythematosus.;2004;Arthritis and rheumatism;Anolik JH;OBJECTIVE: B lymphocyte depletion has recently emerged as a promising approach to the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). As part of a phase I/II dose-ranging trial of rituximab in the treatment of SLE, we evaluated the fate of discrete B cell subsets in the setting of selective depletion by anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and during the B cell recovery phase. METHODS: B cell depletion and phenotype were examined by flow cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells for CD19, CD20, CD27, IgD, and CD38 expression. Changes in autoreactive B lymphocytes and plasma cells were assessed by determination of serum autoantibody levels (anti-double-stranded DNA and VH4.34) and by direct monitoring of a unique autoreactive B cell population bearing surface antibodies  whose heavy chain is encoded by the VH4.34 gene segment. RESULTS: Compared with normal controls, SLE patients displayed several abnormalities in peripheral B cell homeostasis at baseline, including naive lymphopenia, expansion of a CD27-,IgD- (double negative) population, and expansion of circulating plasmablasts. Remarkably, these abnormalities resolved after effective B cell depletion with rituximab and immune reconstitution. The frequency of autoreactive VH4.34 memory B cells also decreased 1 year posttreatment, despite the presence of low levels of residual memory B cells at the point of maximal B cell depletion and persistently elevated serum autoantibody titers in most patients. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to show evidence that in SLE, specific B cell depletion therapy with rituximab dramatically improves abnormalities in B cell homeostasis  and tolerance that are characteristic of this disease. The persistence of elevated autoantibody titers may reflect the presence of low levels of residual autoreactive memory B cells and/or long-lived autoreactive plasma cells.;2004-2006
281;Factors associated with abnormal Pap results in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2004;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Bernatsky S;OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested that women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at greater risk for cervical dysplasia than are women in  the general population. However, the factors associated with abnormal Pap test results in SLE have not been well studied. We therefore aimed to determine the factors associated with lifetime occurrence of an abnormal Pap test in women with SLE, and the influence of immunosuppressive exposure on the odds of abnormal Pap  test results occurring after diagnosis of SLE. METHODS: Data were pooled from SLE cohorts from three centres. Self-report data were available on smoking, reproductive history, use of oral contraceptives (OC), history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and whether the subjects had had cervical dysplasia on Pap testing. Logistic regression was used to examine the effect of these variables on the lifetime odds of cervical dysplasia. We then generated the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the effect of immunosuppressive exposure on cervical dysplasia occurring after diagnosis of SLE. RESULTS: History of STDs and use of OCs were positively associated with reports of cervical dysplasia in adjusted analyses. The ORs for the effect of immunosuppressives on abnormal Pap test occurrence (adjusted for race, age, smoking, nulliparity, OC use and history of STDs) after diagnosis of SLE was 1.6 (95% CI 1.0, 2.7). CONCLUSIONS: A history of STDs and use of OCs were associated with abnormal Pap reports in this SLE sample. Immunosuppressive exposure may confer further risk to women with SLE.;2004-2006

SLE patients were randomly allocated to treatment (estradiol; 50 microg transdermal 17beta-estradiol; n=15) or placebo (  n=17) group. Both groups received 5 mg continuous oral medroxyprogesterone acetate, 500 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D(3). L(1)-L(4) spine (LS), left femur and total hip BMD were measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Serum osteocalcin (OC) and degradation products of C-terminal telopeptides of type-I collagen (CTx) levels were measured at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. There was a significant difference in the percentage change of LS BMD at 6 months between the two groups (103.24+/-3.74% (estradiol group) vs 98.99+/-3.11% (placebo group); P<0.005). There was a significant decrease within the estradiol  group in the CTx levels between baseline and all subsequent visits ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference in SLE disease activity index, Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) damage index and corticosteroid dose during the study period. Transdermal estradiol may  prevent bone loss in postmenopausal SLE women at the lumbar spine and femur, with no increase in disease activity among postmenopausal SLE women receiving transdermal ERT. The high dropout rate (8/15) leads us to the conclusion that efficacy of HRT in a high-risk group such as SLE women can be attained only in a  small number of patients, provided all inclusion/exclusion criteria are strictly  adhered to.";2004-2006
283;Dehydroepiandrosterone suppresses interleukin 10 synthesis in women with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2004;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Chang DM;"OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (prasterone, DHEA) 200  mg/day on cytokine profiles in adult women with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: In a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study conducted as part of a larger multicentre study, 30 adult women with active SLE received oral DHEA 200 mg/day or placebo for 24 weeks. Baseline prednisone (<10 mg/day) and other concomitant SLE medications were to remain constant. The levels of cytokines including interleukin (IL) 1, IL2, interferon gamma, IL4, and IL10 were determined by ELISA. The mean change from baseline to 24 weeks of therapy was analysed. RESULTS: The two groups (DHEA n = 15; placebo n = 15) were  well balanced for baseline characteristics. Only IL1beta and IL10 could be detected in the serum of lupus patients; however, there was no significant mean (SD) difference in serum IL1beta before and after treatment (9.94 (8.92) v 9.20 (6.49) pg/ml). IL10 demonstrated a greater and significant reduction from baseline (9.21 (9.66) to 1.89 (1.47) pg/ml in the DHEA treatment group). CONCLUSIONS: In a 24 week study of adult Chinese women with mild to moderate SLE, treatment with DHEA 200 mg once daily resulted in significant reduction of serum  levels of IL10. This finding may suggest why DHEA could significantly reduce lupus flares.

284;The systemic lupus erythematosus Tri-nation Study: absence of a link between health resource use and health outcome.;2004;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Clarke AE;"OBJECTIVE: Health consumption and health status in SLE in three countries with different health funding structures were compared. METHODS: Seven hundred and fifteen SLE patients (Canada 231, USA 269, UK 215) were surveyed semi-annually over 4 yr for health resource utilization and health status. Cross-country comparisons of (i) cumulative health expenditure (calculated by applying 2002 Canadian prices to resources in all countries) and (ii) disease damage (Systemic  Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index, SLICC/ACR DI) at study conclusion were performed after adjustment. Missing expenditure and damage data were managed through multiple imputation using best predictive regressions with all available data from all patients as potential covariates. RESULTS: Four hundred and eighty-five patients provided data at study entry and conclusion and at least four resource questionnaires (Canada 162, USA 157, UK 166); 41 died (Canada 13, USA 18, UK 10); 189 withdrew, were lost to follow-up or provided data at entry and conclusion but fewer than four resource questionnaires (Canada 56, USA 94, UK 39). At conclusion, after imputation, in Canada, the USA and the UK respectively, mean cumulative costs per patient over 4 yr [95% confidence interval (CI)] were $15,845 (13,509, 18,182), $20,244 (17,764, 22,724) and $17,647 (15,557, 19,737) and mean changes in SLICC/ACR DI were 0.49 (0.39, 0.60), 0.63 (0.52, 0.74) and 0.48 (0.39, 0.57).

285;The clinical effect of dietary supplementation with omega-3 fish oils and/or copper in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2004;The Journal of rheumatology;Duffy EM;OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of dietary supplementation with omega-3 fish oils with or without copper on disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Fish oil supplementation has a beneficial effect on murine models of SLE,  while exogenous copper can decrease the formation of lupus erythematosus cells in rats with a hydralazine-induced collagen disease. METHODS: A double blind, double placebo controlled factorial trial was performed on 52 patients with SLE. Patients were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups. Physiological doses of omega-3 fish oils and copper readily obtainable by dietary means were used. One group received 3 g MaxEPA and 3 mg copper, another 3 g MaxEPA and placebo copper, another 3 mg copper and placebo fish oil, and the fourth group received both placebo capsules. Serial measurements of disease activity using the revised Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM-R) and peripheral blood samples for routine hematological, biochemical, and immunological indices were taken at baseline, 6,  12, and 24 weeks. RESULTS: There was a significant decline in SLAM-R score from 6.12 to 4.69 (p < 0.05) in those subjects taking fish oil compared to placebo. No significant effect on SLAM-R was observed in subjects taking copper. Laboratory variables were unaffected by either intervention. CONCLUSION: In the management of SLE, dietary supplementation with fish oil may be beneficial in modifying symptomatic disease activity.;2004-2006
286;Thyroid disorders and autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis patients.;2004;The Egyptian journal of immunology / Egyptian Association of Immunologists;El-Sherif WT;To determine the patterns of thyroid dysfunction and autoantibodies associated with SLE and RA patients, twenty patients with SLE and another group of twenty with RA were studied. The results were compared with those of twenty apparently healthy age- and sex- matched controls. All patients were subjected to complete history taking, thorough clinical examination and joint examination. All patients and controls were subjected to the following investigations: T3, T4, TSH, antithyroglobulin antibodies (ATGAb) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb). Also, complete blood picture, ESR, RF, ANA, CRP and LE cells were done. This study revealed that thyroid disorders were significantly increased in SLE patients (50%) when compared to RA (15%) (P<0.05). In SLE group, 20% had euthyroid sick syndrome, 20% had hypothyroidism (10% subclinical and 10% biochemical), and 10% had hyperthyroidism (5% subclinical and 5% biochemical). However, in RA, 10% had hypothyroidism (subclinical) and 5% had subclinical hyperthyroidism. TPOAb was found in 15% of SLE and 5% of RA patients and 10% of controls, but the titres were higher in SLE and RA patients. Also, ATGAb was found in 5% of SLE, 30% of RA patients and 10% of controls, but the titres were higher in SLE and RA patients. It is concluded that thyroid abnormalities are more implicated with euthyroid sick syndrome and hypothyroidism (subclinical and  overt) than hyperthyroidism in SLE patients. SLE and RA were associated with antithyroid antibodies (TPOAb in SLE and ATGAb in RA). Performance of thyroid function tests in patients with SLE, in particular and RA as a part of the biochemical and immunological profiles, may help in early detection of associated thyroid disorders.;2004-2006
287;Effects of a stress-reduction program on psychological function, pain, and physical function of systemic lupus erythematosus patients: a randomized controlled trial.;2004;Arthritis and rheumatism;Greco CM;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of a stress-reduction program on pain, psychological function, and physical function in persons with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who experience pain. METHODS: Ninety-two SLE patients were assigned randomly to receive either biofeedback-assisted cognitive-behavioral treatment (BF/CBT), a symptom-monitoring support (SMS) intervention, or usual medical care (UC) alone. RESULTS: BF/CBT participants had significantly greater reductions in pain and psychological dysfunction compared with the SMS group (pain, P = 0.044; psychological functioning, P < 0.001) and the UC group (pain, P = 0.028; psychological functioning, P < 0.001). BF/CBT had significantly greater  improvement in perceived physical function compared with UC (P = 0.035), and improvement relative to SMS was marginally significant (P = 0.097). At a 9-month  followup evaluation, BF/CBT continued to exhibit relative benefit compared with UC in psychological functioning (P = 0.023). CONCLUSION: This study supports the  utility of a brief stress management program for short-term improvement in pain,  psychological function, and perceived physical function among persons with SLE who experience pain.";2004-2006
288;The effect of dehydroepiandrosterone on lumbar spine bone mineral density in patients with quiescent systemic lupus erythematosus.;2004;Arthritis and rheumatism;Hartkamp A;"OBJECTIVE: Because dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is an adrenal steroid hormone with weak intrinsic androgenic properties that can be converted in peripheral tissues into more potent sex hormones, one might expect a positive effect of DHEA on bone mineral density (BMD). We evaluated the effects on lumbar BMD of oral DHEA, 200 mg/day, for 1 year in female patients with quiescent systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: The study subjects were 60 women with SLE. All participants gave informed consent to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the effects of DHEA on fatigue and general well-being. BMD was measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at baseline and after 12 months. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (mean age 42.6 years) could be evaluated; 2 patients (both in the DHEA group) refused to undergo DEXA a second time. In premenopausal women, DHEA did not influence BMD significantly. There was a significant increase in BMD with use of DHEA in postmenopausal women  who were not receiving bisphosphonates or estrogen-containing medications. This increase was not observed in the group receiving placebo. CONCLUSION: In premenopausal women with quiescent SLE, use of DHEA does not have a significant effect on BMD. DHEA may increase BMD in postmenopausal SLE patients if they are not already protected from bone loss by use of estrogens or bisphosphonates. Small numbers, due to the absence of stratification for menopausal status, and the use of antiresorptive agents at randomization preclude firmer conclusions based on the results of this study.";2004-2006
289;Specific antinuclear antibodies are associated with clinical features in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2004;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Hoffman IE;"OBJECTIVES: To study associations between antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and signs/symptoms in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 289 patients with SLE was included; 235 fulfilled ACR criteria for SLE and were further analysed. ANA profiles were determined by line  immunoassay and by indirect immunofluorescence on Crithidia luciliae. An extensive list of signs/symptoms was evaluated. RESULTS: Five clusters of antibodies were defined by cluster analysis: 1-antibodies to SmB, SmD, RNP-A, RNP-C, and RNP-70k; 2-antibodies to Ro52, Ro60, and SSB; 3, 4, and 5-antibodies to ribosomal P, histones and dsDNA, respectively. Significant associations (p< or =0.01) were found between anti-RNP-70k, anti-RNP-A, anti-RNP-C and Raynaud's phenomenon, between anti-RNP-A, anti-RNP-70k and leucopenia, and between anti-RNP-A, anti-RNP-C and a lower prevalence of urine cellular casts. Anti-SSA,  anti-SSB were associated with xerostomia, and anti-SSB with pericarditis. Antibodies to ribosomal P were associated with haemolytic anaemia, leucopenia, and alopecia. Patients with anti-dsDNA antibodies had a higher risk for cellular  casts and a lower risk for photosensitivity. Antihistone antibodies were associated with arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: In a large and consecutive cohort of patients with SLE, clusters of antibodies were identified. Previously reported associations of antibodies with symptoms were confirmed and new associations found.";2004-2006
290;A randomized clinical trial of a psychoeducational intervention to improve outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2004;Arthritis and rheumatism;Karlson EW;"OBJECTIVE: In a cross-sectional study, we previously identified 2 potentially modifiable risk factors for adverse outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): self-efficacy and social support. The goal of this study was to evaluate in a randomized controlled trial a theory-based intervention to improve patient self-efficacy and partner support to manage SLE. METHODS: Patients with SLE ages  18 years and older who met the American College of Rheumatology criteria and were able to identify a partner (spouse or family member) were recruited from 2 academic medical centers and randomized into an experimental group or a control group. Patients in the experimental group and their partners received an intervention designed to enhance self-efficacy, couples communication about lupus, social support, and problem solving, in the form of a 1-hour session with  a nurse educator followed by monthly telephone counseling for 6 months. Patients  in the control group and their partners received an attention placebo, including  a 45-minute video presentation about lupus, and monthly telephone calls. Measures of physical and mental health status, disease activity, and psychosocial factors  were collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The effect of the intervention on physical and mental health and disease activity at 6 and at 12 months was modeled with linear regression and adjusted for baseline health status, disease activity, sociodemographic factors, treatment change, and psychosocial factors. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two patients (plus their partners) were enrolled and randomized as follows: 64 to the experimental intervention and 58 to the attention control group. The participants were predominantly white, approximately half were college educated, and the groups were balanced for sociodemographic factors. At 6 months, significantly higher scores for couples communication (P = 0.01) and problem-focused coping (P = 0.03) were seen in the experimental group compared with the control group. At 12 months (6 months after the intervention ended), social support was higher (4.4 versus 4.1; P = 0.03), self-efficacy was higher (7.2 versus 6.2; P = 0.02), couples communication was higher (3.5 versus 3.1; P = 0.03), and fatigue was lower (5.1 versus 6.3; P = 0.02) in the experimental group compared with the control group.  Global mental health status at 12 months, as measured by the Short Form 36 survey, was 69 points in the experimental group compared with 58 points in the control group (P = 0.04). In multivariate models, adjusting for baseline covariates, scores for couple communication (P = 0.01) were significantly higher  at 6 months, and scores for self-efficacy (P = 0.004) and global mental health status (P = 0.03) were significantly higher at 12 months in the experimental group compared with the control group, and the mean score for global physical function was higher by 7 points, which was a clinically meaningful change (P = 0.2). The mean score for fatigue was also significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group (P = 0.05). SLE disease activity was unchanged by this intervention. CONCLUSION: This randomized, controlled trial of a theory-based educational intervention in SLE demonstrated significantly higher scores for couple communication, self-efficacy, and mental health status, and lower fatigue scores in the experimental group compared with the control group. Because couple communication and self-efficacy appear to be modifiable risk factors, they may also be potential targets in more disadvantaged populations.";2004-2006
291;B cell depletion as a novel treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus: a phase I/II dose-escalation trial of rituximab.;2004;Arthritis and rheumatism;Looney RJ;OBJECTIVE: Safer and more effective therapies are needed for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). B lymphocytes have been shown to play fundamental pathogenic roles in SLE, and therefore, elimination of B cells with the use of rituximab may represent a new therapy for SLE. METHODS: A phase I/II dose-escalation trial of rituximab added to ongoing therapy in SLE was conducted. Rituximab was administered as a single infusion of 100 mg/m2 (low dose), a single infusion of 375 mg/m2 (intermediate dose), or as 4 infusions (1 week apart) of 375 mg/m2 (high dose). CD19+ lymphocytes were measured to determine the effectiveness of B cell depletion. The Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM) score was used as the primary outcome for clinical efficacy. RESULTS: Rituximab was well tolerated in this patient population, with most experiencing no significant adverse effects. Only 3 serious adverse events, which were thought to be unrelated to rituximab administration, were noted. A majority of patients (11  of 17) had profound B cell depletion (to <5 CD19+ B cells/microl). In these patients, the SLAM score was significantly improved at 2 and 3 months compared with baseline (P = 0.0016 and P = 0.0022, respectively, by paired t-test). This improvement persisted for 12 months, despite the absence of a significant change  in anti-double-stranded DNA antibody and complement levels. Six patients developed human antichimeric antibodies (HACAs) at a level > or =100 ng/ml. These HACA titers were associated with African American ancestry, higher baseline SLAM  scores, reduced B cell depletion, and lower levels of rituximab at 2 months after initial infusion. CONCLUSION: Rituximab therapy appears to be safe for the treatment of SLE and holds significant therapeutic promise, at least for the majority of patients experiencing profound B cell depletion. Based on these results, controlled trials of rituximab appear to be warranted.;2004-2006
292;Influenza vaccination of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2004;"Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la";Mercado U;"OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety, the immunogenicity, and the increase of pre-existing autoantibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) following influenza vaccination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen women with SLE received an inactivated influenza vaccine. Antibody titers were measured before and 4 weeks after vaccination using a standardized hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. Disease activity and antinuclear autoantibodies were determined at study entry, at 4 weeks, and at 8 weeks after vaccination. RESULTS: After vaccination, the percentage of patients with anti-hemagglutinin antibody levels increased significantly but was lower than in healthy women. Mean antibody titer  of patients increased significantly but also was lower than that of controls. Both the mean of disease activity and anti-ds DNA antibody decreased significantly. Adverse effects to the vaccine were mild. CONCLUSIONS: a) Influenza vaccination appears to be safe; b). Antibody response to influenza vaccination increases significantly for all 3 influenza antigens; c) Specific antibody response is not significantly affected by treatment, age, IgG levels, or disease activity.";2004-2006
293;Linkage analysis of SLE susceptibility: confirmation of SLER1 at 5p15.3.;2004;Genes and immunity;Nath SK;We detected a novel susceptibility gene, SLER1, for systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) at 5p15.3.(1) This finding was based on a selected subgroup of SLE families, where two or more family members have had alleged rheumatoid arthritis  (SLE-RA). The main objective of this study was to replicate the linkage at 5p15.3 based on an independent data set of 88 SLE-RA families. Heterogeneity in the genetic model led us to use a nonparametric allele-sharing method. Since our a priori hypothesis of linkage at 5p15.3 was fixed, we genotyped six markers at the linked region. Our new results replicate the initial linkage at 5p15.3 (Zlr=2.58, P<0.005, LOD=1.45). Moreover, evidence of linkage was sustained when analysis was restricted to the subset of SLE families who had 3 or more individuals with alleged RA (Zlr=3.32, P=0.008, LOD=2.40) The results of our previous findings, together with these new results, confirm the SLER1 linkage at 5p15.3. Our results also demonstrate the utility of clinically defined subgroup analysis for detecting susceptibility loci for complex genetic diseases, such as SLE.;2004-2006
294;A pilot study of the use of 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography to assess the distribution of activated lymphocytes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2004;Arthritis and rheumatism;Nowak M;OBJECTIVE: The 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) technique provides information on uptake and metabolism of glucose in various tissues. Compared with resting cells, activated lymphocytes take up radioactively labeled glucose analog at a higher rate, which makes it possible to identify lymphoid organs with higher concentrations of activated lymphocytes. This study was undertaken to compare the pattern of PET images and quantitative FDG uptake in lymphoid organs of patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) versus patients with inactive SLE and to correlate these findings with peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotypes. METHODS: Ten patients with  active SLE and 9 patients with inactive SLE were studied. FDG-PET images were obtained from the inguinal region to above the ear, starting at 60 minutes after  injection of FDG. Standardized uptake values using lean body mass were determined over areas of interest. RESULTS: Both patients with active lupus and those with inactive lupus had increased FDG uptake in lymph nodes when compared with healthy volunteers, and there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups of lupus patients. Thymic uptake was demonstrated in 5 of 10 patients with active lupus compared with 0 of 9 patients with inactive disease. Three of the 5  patients with active SLE who were over 29 years of age had thymic uptake. Of the  activation markers tested, only the CD3/CD71 population of cells was significantly different between the patient groups, with an increased percentage  in the active disease group (P = 0.0247). CONCLUSION: Increased FDG uptake in lymph nodes of both patients with active SLE and patients with inactive SLE suggests that metabolic, and probably immunologic, activity is enhanced not only  in active, but also in clinically quiescent, disease. The increased thymic uptake observed only in patients with active disease suggests that the thymus plays an important role during periods of disease activity.;2004-2006
295;Systemic lupus erythematosus and genetic variation in the interleukin 1 gene cluster: a population based study in the southeastern United States.;2004;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Parks CG;BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)1alpha and IL1beta, and their endogenous receptor antagonist (IL1Ra), have been related to the pathology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the role of IL1 polymorphisms in the aetiology of SLE is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine polymorphisms at IL1alpha -889(C-->T), IL1alpha +4845(C-->T), IL1beta -511(C-->T), IL1beta +3953(G-->T), and IL1Ra (86 bp VNTR) in a population based study of SLE in North Carolina and South Carolina. METHODS: Genotypes from 230 cases who met ACR classification criteria, and from 275 controls matched for age, sex, and state, were analysed separately for African Americans and whites. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by logistic regression models for each locus alone and also after adjusting for polymorphisms at adjacent loci. RESULTS: An increased risk of SLE for the IL1alpha -889C/C genotype compared with carriage of the -889T allele was found in both African Americans (OR = 3.1, p = 0.001) and whites (OR = 2.9, p = 0.005). In African Americans, carriage of the IL1beta -511T allele was associated with a higher risk of SLE than carriage of the -511C/C genotype (OR = 2.4, p = 0.017), independent of variation at IL1alpha -889. CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations support the hypothesis that genetic variation in IL1 is involved in the aetiology of SLE and  merit further investigation.;2004-2006
296;First clinical trials of a new heteropolymer technology agent in normal healthy volunteers and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: safety and proof of principle of the antigen-heteropolymer ETI-104.;2004;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Iking-Konert C;"BACKGROUND: The heteropolymer technology was developed to remove pathogens from the circulation. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single  administration and to establish proof of principle for ETI-104 in normal healthy  volunteers (NHV) and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) METHODS: The drug was given intravenously to 11 NHV and six patients with SLE. Over 28 days, vital signs were noted, a haematological and chemical analysis of blood and urine was carried out, and adverse events were recorded. CR1 receptor numbers, the ability of antigen based heteropolymers to bind to red blood cells (RBCs), and the clearance of high avidity and total anti-dsDNA antibodies were measured by Farr assays and FACS analysis. RESULTS: No safety measure differed significantly from normal in both groups; no drug related serious adverse events  occurred. ETI-104 rapidly bound to RBCs in NHV and patients with SLE. Binding of  the drug to RBCs of patients with SLE also caused a rapid reduction of circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies in the plasma 15 minutes after administration,  with a maximum reduction of 55% (range 43-62). At 28 days statistically significant decreases were maintained in three patients, while in the other three the values had returned to baseline levels. CONCLUSION: These clinical trials established the safety and the proof of principle of the new immunoconjugate ETI-104. This provides the basis for further development of this technology for numerous indications-for example, therapeutic options for autoimmune diseases or  viral and bacterial infections. ";2004-2006
297;Effects of prasterone on disease activity and symptoms in women with active systemic lupus erythematosus.;2004;Arthritis and rheumatism;Petri MA;"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prasterone administration results in improvement  or stabilization of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity and its symptoms. METHODS: Women with active SLE were treated with prasterone 200 mg/day  plus standard SLE treatments or with placebo plus standard SLE treatments for up  to 12 months in this randomized, double-blind investigation conducted at 27 centers. Standard SLE treatments included prednisone (</=10 mg/day), antimalarials, and immunosuppressive agents; dosages were required to be stable for >/=6 weeks prior to enrollment and remain unchanged during protocol treatment. Responders were patients who experienced no clinical deterioration and had improvement or stabilization over the duration of the study in 2 disease activity measures (the SLE Disease Activity Index [SLEDAI] and the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure) and 2 quality of life measures (patient's global assessment and the Krupp Fatigue Severity Scale). RESULTS: A total of 381 women with SLE were enrolled. Among patients with clinically active disease at baseline (SLEDAI score >2), 86 of 147 in the prasterone group (58.5%) demonstrated improvement or stabilization without clinical deterioration, as compared with 65 of 146 in the placebo group (44.5%) (P = 0.017). Acne and hirsutism were reported in 33% and 16%, respectively, of the prasterone group and in 14% and 2%, respectively, of the placebo group (P < 0.05 for both comparisons). However, most cases of acne and hirsutism were mild and did not require withdrawal from therapy. Myalgias and oral stomatitis were reported less frequently in the prasterone group (22% and 15%, respectively) than in the placebo group (36% and 23%, respectively) (P < 0.05 for both comparisons). Serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and C3 complement significantly decreased, while levels of testosterone and, to a lesser extent, estradiol increased in the prasterone group. CONCLUSION: In adult women with active SLE, administration of prasterone at a dosage of 200 mg/day improved or stabilized signs and symptoms of disease and was generally well tolerated.";2004-2006

299;Therapy with intermittent pulse cyclophosphamide for pulmonary hypertension associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2004;Lupus;Gonzalez-Lopez L;"The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCYC) versus oral enalapril in mild or moderate pulmonary hypertension (PH) in  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Thirty-four patients with SLE who had systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) > 30 mmHg by Doppler echocardiography were randomized to receive IVCYC (0.5 g/mt2 body surface area, monthly), or oral  enalapril (10 mg/day) for six months. The primary outcome was the significant decrease in SPAP. An additional outcome measure included the improvement in the heart functional class (NYHA). Sixteen patients received cyclophosphamide and 18  enalapril. IVCYC decreased the median values of SPAP from 41 to 28 mmHg (P < 0.001), and enalapril from 35 to 27 mmHg (P = 0.02). IVCYC reduced more than twice as much SPAP than enalapril (P = 0.04). In those patients with SPAP > or =  35 mmHg, cyclophosphamide decreased from 43 to 27 mmHg (P = 0.003), but enalapril was not effective (P = 0.14). The NYHA functional class improved only in those with cyclophosphamide (P = 0.021). Also IVCYC had a higher frequency of side effects including infections (RR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.001-2.47), and gastrointestinal side effects (RR = 14.6; 95% CI, 2.15-99.68). We concluded that IVCYC was effective in mild and moderate PH associated with SLE. Further research is needed to evaluate its long-term efficacy. ";2004-2006
300;"The GLADEL multinational Latin American prospective inception cohort of 1,214 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: ethnic and disease heterogeneity among ""Hispanics"".";2004;Medicine;Pons-Estel BA;"Clinical and laboratory manifestations and outcome of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may vary in different populations. A prospective multinational inception cohort should prove useful in identifying the influence of ethnicity on the clinical characteristics of SLE. We therefore analyzed clinical, laboratory, and prognostic variables in Latin American SLE patients with disease of recent onset who were entered into a prospective cohort, and compared these variables in the cohort's 3 major ethnic groups. Thirty-four centers from 9 Latin American countries participated by randomly incorporating SLE patients within 2 years of diagnosis into a standardized database. Participating centers were selected for their expertise in diagnosing and managing SLE. We were then able to evaluate prospectively socioeconomic variables, ethnicity, type of medical care, clinical and laboratory features, disease activity, damage, and mortality at each site. A coordinating center controlled the quality of the information submitted. Of the 1,214 SLE patients included in the cohort, 537 were mestizos, 507 were white, and 152 were African-Latin American (ALA). (There were also small numbers of pure Amerindian and oriental individuals.) Significant differences were found between them in socioeconomic characteristics, type of care, and level of education favoring whites. Mestizos and ALA were younger at onset. Delay to diagnosis and disease duration was shorter in ALA. Fever was more frequent in whites; discoid lesions in ALA; renal disease and lymphopenia in mestizos and ALA. Although we found differences in background variables between ethnic groups from different countries, mestizos from 2 distant countries (Argentina and Mexico) were clinically akin and showed similar differences to whites. Mortality was associated with lower education, poor medical coverage, and shorter follow-up. In an exploratory model nonwhite ethnicity was associated with renal disease and lymphopenia, damage, and cumulative American College of Rheumatology criteria. These differences in clinical, prognostic, socioeconomic, educational, and access to medical care features in Latin American lupus patients of 3 major ethnic groups from 9 different countries may have an impact on the patients' disease. ""Hispanics,"" as they have come to be generically termed on the basis of language, actually constitute a markedly heterogeneous group of subjects.";2004-2006
301;Measuring systemic lupus erythematosus activity during pregnancy: validation of the lupus activity index in pregnancy scale.;2004;Arthritis and rheumatism;Ruiz-Irastorza G;OBJECTIVE: To validate the Lupus Activity Index in Pregnancy (LAI-P) scale as a diagnostic tool for lupus flares during pregnancy and the puerperium. METHODS: The LAI-P is a modified activity scale specific for pregnancy. Thirty-eight pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were prospectively followed in 3 clinics specific for lupus in pregnancy. On each visit, LAI-P was calculated. A modified physician global assessment (m-PGA) scale was used as gold standard (0 = no activity, 1 = mild-moderate activity, 2 = severe activity). A change > or = 0.25 in LAI-P was predefined as a flare according to previous studies in nonpregnant patients. For the purposes of the study, each visit was considered as an independent case. RESULTS: During the study period, 158 visits took place for a total 621 patient-weeks. Sensitivity to change was high (standardized response mean for LAI-P = 1.6). We found a significant association  between LAI-P and m-PGA (P < 0.002 in all regression models performed). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 0.93,  0.98, 0.88, and 0.99. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 49 and 0.07, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: LAI-P has a high sensitivity to changes in lupus activity, a significant correlation with m-PGA, and high sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios for diagnosing SLE flares during pregnancy and the puerperium.;2004-2006
302;Health-related quality of life in juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus and its relationship to disease activity and damage.;2004;Arthritis and rheumatism;Ruperto N;OBJECTIVE: To assess the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of patients with juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) and its relationship with disease activity and accumulated damage. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study,  HRQL was assessed using the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ), disease activity using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), and accumulated damage using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI). RESULTS: A total of  297 patients were included. The mean +/- SD physical and psychosocial summary scores of the CHQ were 40.2 +/- 15.0 and 44.8 +/- 10.7, respectively. The most impaired CHQ subscales were global health, general health perceptions, and parent impact-emotional. The SLEDAI score was significantly correlated with both the physical summary score (r = -0.29, P < 0.0001) and psychosocial summary score (r  = -0.25, P < 0.0001), whereas the SDI score was significantly correlated only with the physical summary score (r = -0.23, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: We found that patients with JSLE have significant impairment of their HRQL, particularly in the physical domain. HRQL may be affected by both disease activity and accumulated damage, particularly in the renal, central nervous, and musculoskeletal systems.;2004-2006
303;Nutrient intake and diet quality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus on a culturally sensitive cholesterol lowering dietary program.;2004;The Journal of rheumatology;Shah M;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a culturally sensitive cholesterol lowering  dietary program on energy, protein, fiber, vitamin and mineral intake, diet quality, and hemoglobin levels in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Seventeen patients with SLE were randomized to a Step II diet intervention group or a control group for 12 weeks. The diet intervention was made up of weekly group sessions during the first 6 weeks followed by telephone counseling every 2 weeks for the last 6 weeks. Food intake was assessed by 3-day  food record at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks. Diet quality was assessed by expressing the nutrients as a percentage of the Dietary Reference Intakes of the US National Academy of Sciences, or as a percentage of the nutrient guidelines by the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III. Between- and within-group changes in nutrient intakes were assessed by repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: The changes in nutrient intakes were not significantly different  between the groups for any of the nonfat nutrients except vitamin B12 (p = 0.05), which decreased in the diet group and increased in the control group. Within-group analysis showed a significant reduction (p = 0.0003 to 0.02) in the  diet group in energy and sodium intake at 6 and 12 weeks and B12 intake at 12 weeks compared to the respective baseline values (28-32%, 37-41%, and 43%, respectively). Sodium intake decreased to 66-71% of the total sodium allowance (< 2400 mg per day) in the diet group. The intervention was successful in maintaining adequate intakes or even increasing intakes of most nutrients except  B12, dietary fiber, folate, calcium, and iron, which were slightly higher or below 67% of the Dietary Reference Intakes or other dietary guidelines. Anemia, as assessed by hemoglobin levels, was present throughout the study and did not correlate with iron intake. CONCLUSION: This culturally sensitive cholesterol reducing diet program was successful in decreasing sodium intake and maintaining  adequate intakes of most nutrients except B12, dietary fiber, iron, calcium, and  folate. Future intervention studies in patients with SLE need to pay special attention to these nutrients and the presence of anemia.;2004-2006
304;Mycophenolate therapy of SLE membranous nephropathy.;2004;Kidney international;Spetie DN;BACKGROUND: The immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid (MMF) has been used successfully to manage proliferative forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  glomerulonephritis (GN) World Health Organization (WHO) Classes III and IV. Less  is known about MMF treatment of membranous SLE GN (WHO Class V, SLE MN). METHODS: We report our experience with MMF therapy in 13 consecutive SLE MN patients participating in a prospective study of risk factors for SLE flare. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were: mean age 33 +/- 14 SD years, female/male ratio 11/2, Caucasians 7, African Americans 5, Oriental 1, serum creatinine 1.02 +/- 0.41, and mean 24-hour urine protein (P)/creatinine (C), ratio 5.1 +/- 4.1. Initial therapy was prednisone mean dose 31 +/- 17 mg/day, and MMF mean dose 1173 +/- 746 mg/day. Therapy also featured interventions to achieve renoprotection and proteinuria reduction. At 6 months of therapy, complete or partial remission was  achieved in 10 of 13 patients. At most recent follow-up visit (mean follow-up 16  +/- 8 months), 9 of 13 patients were in complete remission, and in 11 of 13 patients, urine P/C ratio was < 0.8. During follow-up, serum creatinine either stabilized or was improved. The only serious complication during 208 patient months of follow-up was histoplasma pneumonia in 1 patient. CONCLUSION: These promising results suggest that moderate dose MMF in combination with renoprotective/antiproteinuria therapy warrants further study in the management of SLE MN.;2004-2006
305;Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study of leflunomide in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2004;Lupus;Tam LS;Twelve systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with mild to moderate disease  activity (SLEDAI of > or = 6 and on prednisolone < 0.5 mg/kg/day) were included in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study for 24 weeks. Six were randomized to receive oral leflunomide and six received placebo.  Primary outcome of this study included the mean change of SLEDAI at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the changes in proteinuria, complement levels, anti ds-DNA binding, and prednisolone dosage. The mean age of the 12 patients was 41+/-9 years, and the mean disease duration was 8.5+/-5.8 years. All were female  except one patient. The disease activity of both groups of patients decreased significantly after six months of treatment (14.7+/-6.0 to 3.7+/-2.3 in leflunomide group, P = 0.028, and 9.7+/-3.4 to 5.2+/-4.1 in placebo group, P = 0.027). Reduction in the SLEDAI from baseline to 24 weeks was significantly greater in the leflunomide group than the placebo group (11.0+/-6.1 in the leflunomide group and 4.5+/-2.4 in the placebo group respectively, P = 0.026). Minor adverse events included transient elevation in ALT, hypertension and transient leucopenia. In summary, leflunomide was more effective than placebo in  treating SLE patients with mild to moderate disease activity and was safe and well-tolerated.;2004-2006
306;Systemic lupus erythematosus in a multiethnic US cohort (LUMINA). XXIII. Baseline predictors of vascular events.;2004;Arthritis and rheumatism;Toloza SM;OBJECTIVE: To determine the baseline (time 0) risk factors associated with the subsequent occurrence of vascular events in a multiethnic US cohort (LUMINA [LUpus in MInorities: NAture versus nurture]) of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Five hundred forty-six LUMINA patients were assessed at time 0 for traditional and nontraditional (disease-related) risk factors for vascular events. These were defined as 1) cardiovascular (myocardial  infarction and/or definite or classic angina and/or the undergoing of a vascular  procedure for myocardial infarction [coronary artery bypass graft]), 2) cerebrovascular (stroke), and 3) peripheral vascular (arterial claudication and/or gangrene or significant tissue loss and/or arterial thrombosis in peripheral arteries). The observation time (followup time in the cohort) was the  interval between time 0 and the last visit. The unit of analysis was the patient  and not each vascular event. Variables at time 0 and vascular events were examined by univariable and multivariable (logistic and Cox proportional hazards  regression) analyses. Age, sex, ethnicity, followup time, and all known risk factors for the occurrence of vascular events were included in the model. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (6.2%) developed one or more vascular event after time 0. The overall median duration of followup in the cohort was 73.8 months (range 10.8-111.3 months). Vascular events (13 cardiovascular, 18 cerebrovascular, 5 peripheral vascular) occurred in 7 Hispanics from Texas (6.5%), 1 Hispanic from Puerto Rico (1.2%), 15 African Americans (7.5%), and 11 Caucasians (7.1%). The mean total number of traditional risk factors was significantly higher in patients who developed vascular events than in those who  did not (7.1 versus 5.6). Independent predictors of vascular events were older age, current smoking status, longer followup time, elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and the presence of any antiphospholipid antibody. The  same variables were identified when time-dependent analyses were performed, although azathioprine use was also found to be a contributing factor. CONCLUSION: Smoking, previously not reported in SLE, emerged as a predictor of vascular events and should be strongly discouraged. Antiphospholipid antibodies and CRP support the role of inflammation and autoimmunity in the development of accelerated atherosclerosis in SLE. Ethnicity was not associated with vascular events in our patients.;2004-2006
307;Decreased levels of soluble amyloid beta-protein precursor and beta-amyloid protein in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2004;Arthritis research & therapy;Trysberg E;Symptoms originating from the central nervous system (CNS) frequently occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These symptoms are extremely diverse, including a state of dementia. The aim of this study was to examine the  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) content of soluble molecules indicating axonal degeneration and amyloidogenesis. One hundred and fourteen patients with SLE and  age-matched controls were evaluated clinically, with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and CSF analyses. Levels of tau, amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-amyloid protein (Abeta42), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) were all determined using sandwich ELISAs.APP and Abeta42 levels were significantly decreased in SLE patients irrespective of their CNS involvement, as compared with healthy controls. Patients with neuropsychiatric SLE who underwent  a second lumbar puncture following successful cyclophosphamide treatment showed further decreases of Abeta42. CSF-tau levels were significantly increased in SLE  patients showing magnetic resonance imaging-verified brain pathology as compared  with SLE patients without such engagement. Importantly, tau levels displayed significant correlation to Abeta42 levels in the CSF. Finally, TGF-beta levels were significantly increased in patients with neuropsychiatric SLE as compared with those without. Low intrathecal levels of Abeta42 found in SLE patients seem  to be a direct consequence of a diminished production of APP, probably mediated by heavy anti-inflammatory/immuno-suppressive therapy. Furthermore, our findings  suggest that CSF tau can be used as a biochemical marker for neuronal degeneration in SLE. Finally, the increased TGF-beta levels observed may support  a notion of an ongoing anti-inflammatory response counteracting tissue injury caused by CNS lupus.;2004-2006
308;Efficacy of mizoribine in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in children.;2004;Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society;Yoshidome K;BACKGROUND: Mizoribine (MZR) is a novel immunosuppressant developed in Japan. As  MZR is reported to be less toxic than other cytotoxic drugs, it is frequently used in Japan in the treatment of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis or lupus nephritis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of MZR  in children with SLE. Nine female children with lupus nephritis who had undergone renal biopsy before starting MZR, were involved in this study. Their mean disease duration was 4.8 years at the time MZR treatment was initiated. Patients who had  received intensive medications, such as methyl-prednisolone pulse therapy, intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy, and/or other immunosuppressants, within the 4 months prior to the start of the study, were excluded. METHODS: Patients treated with 3 mg/kg per day of MZR were monitored every month for up to 1 year. The efficacy of MZR was evaluated by the changes from baseline values of  serum C3, serum C4, anti-dsDNA antibody titer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urinary protein, dosage of prednisolone (PSL), and the sum of the scores defined by these parameters. RESULTS: Favorable changes were observed in C3 and ESR after 2 months and 3 months of MZR therapy, respectively. At 3 months of MZR  therapy, the sum of scores defined by the parameters for disease activity indicated that MZR was more effective in non-class IV nephritis patients (n = 5)  than in class IV nephritis patients (n = 4) (P = 0.0197). All nine children involved in the study tolerated the MZR therapy well during the study. CONCLUSION: MZR was safe in lupus children, but its efficacy was limited in patients with non-class IV nephritis. Further study is necessary, in which higher dosages and/or earlier use of MZR is provided to a larger number of children.;2004-2006
309;LJP 394 for the prevention of renal flare in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.;2003;Arthritis and rheumatism;Alarcon-Segovia D;"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether LJP 394 delays or prevents renal flare in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a history of renal disease.  METHODS: In a 76-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 230 SLE patients were randomized to receive 16 weekly doses of 100 mg of LJP 394 or placebo, followed by alternating 8-week drug holidays and 12 weekly doses of 50 mg of LJP  394 or placebo. An assay measuring the affinity of the serum IgG fraction for the DNA epitope of LJP 394 identified a high-affinity population of patients (189 of  213 patients; 89% taking LJP 394 and 90% taking placebo). Analyses were performed on both the intent-to-treat population and the high-affinity population. RESULTS: Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies decreased and C3 levels tended to increase during treatment with LJP 394. In the intent-to-treat population, the time to renal flare was not significantly different between treatment groups, but patients taking LJP 394 had a longer time to institution of high-dose corticosteroids and/or cyclophosphamide (HDCC) and required 41% fewer treatments  with HDCC. In the high-affinity population, the LJP 394 group experienced a longer time to renal flare, 67% fewer renal flares, longer time to institution of HDCC, and 62% fewer HDCC treatments compared with the placebo group. In patients  with serum creatinine levels >/=1.5 mg/dl at study entry, those taking LJP 394 had 50% fewer renal flares; no renal flares were observed in the high-affinity group taking LJP 394. Serious adverse events were observed in 25 of the 114 LJP 394-treated patients (21.9%) and 34 of the 116 placebo-treated patients (29.3%).  CONCLUSION: Treatment with LJP 394 in patients with high-affinity antibodies to its DNA epitope prolonged the time to renal flare, decreased the number of renal  flares, and required fewer HDCC treatments compared with placebo. The study drug  appeared to be well tolerated.";2001-2003
310;The relationship of FcgammaRIIIa genotype to degree of B cell depletion by rituximab in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.;2003;Arthritis and rheumatism;Anolik JH;OBJECTIVE: Despite wide use of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in the treatment of B cell lymphomas, the mechanism by which it causes B cell depletion  remains a subject of controversy. As part of an ongoing phase I/II trial of rituximab in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we sought to determine whether the effectiveness of B cell depletion was influenced by polymorphisms of Fc receptors (FcR) on effector cells. METHODS: During rituximab  treatment of 12 SLE patients, B cell depletion was monitored as a function of the serum rituximab level and FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIIa genotypes at baseline and  at 1 month and 2 months after treatment. FcR genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction. Serum levels of rituximab were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). B lymphocyte percentages were assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: B cell depletion was highly variable in this patient  cohort, with B cell percentages at the 1-2-month posttreatment nadir ranging from undetectable (<0.1 cell/microl) to 16% ( approximately 30 cells/microl) of the total peripheral blood lymphocytes. At 2 months posttreatment, B cell percentages were highly correlated with both the serum rituximab level and the FcgammaRIIIa genotype (R(2) = 0.75, P = 0.002). The FcgammaRIIIa genotype was a significant independent predictor of the efficacy of B cell depletion (P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: These results highlight the potential variability of B cell depletion by rituximab in the treatment of autoimmune disease and indicate that Fc receptors are an important determinant of that variability. The findings further  suggest the importance of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and/or apoptosis induction via FcgammaRIIIa-expressing effector cells in the mechanism of B cell depletion by this widely used monoclonal antibody.;2001-2003
311;Mycophenolate mofetil prevents a clinical relapse in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus at risk.;2003;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Bijl M;BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterised by the presence of antibodies to double stranded DNA (dsDNA), which are involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. Previous studies showed that at least two thirds of patients develop a clinical relapse within six months after a significant rise in the anti-dsDNA level, and most relapses were prevented by the administration of corticosteroids at the time of the rise. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether mofetil  mycophenolate (MMF) can prevent a clinical relapse without the side effects associated with corticosteroids. METHODS: 36 patients with SLE were examined monthly to determine whether a rise in anti-dsDNA level had occurred. A rise was  defined as an increase of 25% of the level of the previous sample of at least 15  IU/ml within a four month period. After a rise patients were treated with MMF 2000 mg daily for six months. Patients were monitored monthly for the occurrence  of a clinical relapse and to assess the serological activity and state of activation of CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocyte subsets. RESULTS: Anti-dsDNA rose  in 10 patients. Treatment with MMF was started in all these patients, and after six months no clinical relapse had occurred. Side effects were minimal. Antibodies to dsDNA decreased during the treatment (p<0.001), associated with a decrease in the state of activation of CD19+ lymphocytes. No changes were found in the state of activation of CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocyte subsets. CONCLUSION: Administration of MMF after a rise in antibodies to dsDNA is well tolerated, decreases anti-dsDNA and B cell activation, and seems to prevent the occurrence of a clinical relapse in patients with SLE.;2001-2003
312;Lupus headaches in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: relationship to  disease activity as measured by the systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) and disease damage.;2003;Lupus;Brunner HI;The Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) is the most commonly used measure of disease activity for children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). For headaches to be scored in the SLEDAI as a symptom of active disease, they have to be nonresponsive to narcotic analgesia. This may affect the overall estimation of disease activity, especially because headaches are common among children with SLE and narcotic analgesia is rarely used for headache therapy in paediatrics. Moreover, the importance of headaches for the development of damage and their relation to other clinical parameters and outcomes has not been well described for children with SLE. We reviewed the medical charts of an inception cohort of children (n = 63) who were newly diagnosed with SLE. Information on headaches and other disease parameters was obtained. Disease activity and damage were measured using the SLEDAI and the Systemic Lupus International Collaboration Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI), respectively. It has been shown that the accumulated burden of active disease as measured by serial SLEDAI scores over time is one of the best predictors of eventual damage to children with SLE. New-onset or significant increase of severe and/or persistent headaches (LHA) were reported in 43% of the patients during a mean follow-up of 3.6 years. LHA occurred preferentially among patients with elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) (P < 0.02) and only 6% of all LHA episodes were treated with narcotics and thus considered for the measurement of disease activity in the SLEDAI. LHA were unrelated to proxy-measures of disease activity, such as the need to intensify therapies. When used in children, the insensitivity of the SLEDAI to capture LHA did not seem to decrease the responsiveness of the SLEDAI to detect clinically important worsening of disease, or negatively impact on its  ability to predict damage.;2001-2003
313;Salivary and serum beta2-microglobulin and gamma-glutamyl-transferase in patients with primary Sjogren syndrome and Sjogren syndrome secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus.;2003;"Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry";Castro J;BACKGROUND: Sialochemistry has been proposed as a simple and useful tool for the  diagnosis of Sjogren syndrome (SS). Although many changes have been detected in several constituents of saliva from patients with SS, none are individually sensitive or specific enough for diagnosing SS. The aim of this study was to assess the value of the combined determination of beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) and gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) activity in serum and saliva as a diagnostic instrument for differentiating primary and secondary [to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)] SS patients from normal subjects. METHODS: Nineteen primary  SS (pSS) patients, 15 patients with SS secondary to SLE, and 25 SLE patients without SS were studied. Thirty healthy subjects were included in the study as control group. RESULTS: By means of a mathematical model, (a) 84.1%, (b) 85.7%, and (c) 87.0% of patients were correctly classified as SS or normal when (a) salivary beta2m and GGT values, (b) serum beta2m and salivary GGT values, and (c) salivary beta2m and GGT along with serum beta2m values, respectively, were considered. To differentiate between pSS and sSS by means of the mathematical model, the combination of serum beta2m and salivary GGT values achieved that 81.8% of the patients were correctly classified. CONCLUSION: Since sialochemistry is an easy, safe and reliable test, the combined determination of beta2m and GGT  in saliva and serum was useful for differentiating SS patients from normal subjects, but not excessively good for differentiating pSS from sSS patients.;2001-2003
314;TAP1 and TAP2 polymorphisms analysis in northwestern Colombian patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2003;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Correa PA;"OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of TAP1 and TAP2 alleles in northwestern Colombian patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Unselected patients with SLE (n=140) and controls (n=120) matched for sex, age, and ethnicity were analysed. Clinical manifestations, clinical activity, and severity of disease were recorded. Autoantibodies were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). TAP1 and TAP2 polymorphisms were determined by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction. A Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test, microdifferentiation analysis, linkage disequilibrium analysis, and haplotype and allele frequency comparisons were performed. RESULTS: The TAP2 variant Val379/Ala565/Ala665 (allele TAP2*0201) was  associated with SLE (56% v 39%; odds ratio=2, 95% confidence interval 1.22 to 3.30, p(c)=0.03). There was no stratification between patient and control samples. Linkage disequilibrium between TAP1 and TAP2 loci was found in controls  but not in patients. An excess in the number of heterozygotes in the TAP2 locus was found in patients. No association between TAP1 and TAP2 variants and the presence of autoantibodies, clinical expression, or severity of disease was found. CONCLUSIONS: The TAP2 locus influences susceptibility to SLE in our patient group; however, it has no significant effect on the immune response or on the clinical course of the disease.";2001-2003
315;Group psychotherapy reduces illness intrusiveness in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2003;The Journal of rheumatology;Edworthy SM;OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether brief supportive-expressive group psychotherapy might reduce illness-induced interference with valued activities and interests (i.e., illness intrusiveness) among women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in relation to 3 life domains: (1) relationships and personal development (family relationships, other social relationships, self-expression),  (2) intimacy (relationship with spouse, sex life), and/or (3) instrumental life (work, finances, active recreation). METHODS: Women with SLE recruited from 9 rheumatology centers were randomly assigned to receive either usual care (n = 66) or a 12 week brief supportive-expressive group psychotherapy followed by 3 monthly booster sessions (n = 58). Standard instruments assessed disease activity and damage, illness intrusiveness, and psychological distress at 4 measurement occasions: (1) pretreatment, (2) posttreatment, (3) 6 month followup, and (4) 12  month followup. RESULTS: Analysis of covariance, controlling for disease activity and household income, indicated that women who received brief supportive-expressive group psychotherapy experienced significant reductions in illness intrusiveness for 2 of 3 domains: (1) relationships and personal development and (2) intimacy. Benefits were evident at 6 and 12 month followups.  CONCLUSION: Brief supportive-expressive group psychotherapy facilitates adaptation to SLE by assisting women in reducing illness-induced disruptions into important domains of life experience.;2001-2003
316;Abnormal germinal center reactions in systemic lupus erythematosus demonstrated by blockade of CD154-CD40 interactions.;2003;The Journal of clinical investigation;Grammer AC;To determine the role of CD154-CD40 interactions in the B cell overactivity exhibited by patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), CD19+ peripheral B cells were examined before and after treatment with humanized anti-CD154 mAb (BG9588, 5c8). Before treatment, SLE patients manifested activated B cells that expressed CD154, CD69, CD38, CD5, and CD27. Cells expressing CD38, CD5, or CD27 disappeared from the periphery during treatment with anti-CD154 mAb, and cells expressing CD69 and CD154 disappeared from the periphery during the post-treatment period. Before treatment, active-SLE patients had circulating CD38 (bright) Ig-secreting cells that were not found in normal individuals. Disappearance of this plasma cell subset during treatment was associated with decreases in anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) Ab levels, proteinuria, and SLE disease activity index. Consistent with this finding, peripheral B cells cultured in vitro spontaneously proliferated and secreted Ig in a manner that was inhibited by anti-CD154 mAb. Finally, the CD38(+/++)IgD(+), CD38(+++), and CD38(+)IgD(-) B cell subsets present in the peripheral blood also disappeared following treatment with humanized anti-CD154. Together, these results indicate that patients with active lupus nephritis exhibit abnormalities in the peripheral B cell compartment that are consistent with intensive germinal center activity, are driven via CD154-CD40 interactions, and may reflect or contribute to the propensity of these patients to produce autoantibodies.;2001-2003
317;Independent association of HLA-DR and FCgamma receptor polymorphisms in Korean patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2003;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Lee HS;OBJECTIVES: To determine the distribution of HLA-DR type and FcgammaRIIa/IIIa polymorphisms, and to analyse the combined effects of these genes for susceptibility in Korean systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. METHODS: A  total of 299 SLE patients meeting 1982 ACR criteria and 144 Korean disease-free controls were enrolled. Genotyping for the FcgammaRIIa 131 R/H and FcgammaRIIIa 176 F/V was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of genomic DNA using allele-specific primers. HLA-DRB1 typing was performed by the PCR-SSOP method. RESULTS: There was significant skewing in the distribution of the three FcgammaRIIa genotypes between the SLE patients and the controls [P = 0.002 for R/R131 vs R/H131 and H/H131, relative risk (RR) 2.6 (95% CI 1.3-5.2)], but not in FcgammaRIIIa genotypes. HLA-DRB1*15 allele was significantly more prevalent among SLE patients than the control population [P < 0.02, RR = 1.7 (1.1-2.6)]. HLA-DRB1 genotypes or allele frequencies of the SLE patients with nephritis did not differ significantly from those of the SLE patients without nephritis. We analysed the combined effects of the two candidate genes on SLE susceptibility. HLA-DRB1*15 allele was a significant predictor of SLE in individuals who were not homozygous  for FcgammaRIIa-R/R131 [RR = 2.1 (1.2-3.7), P < 0.008], and the FcgammaRIIa-R/R131 genotype vice versa [RR = 5.3 (1.9-15.4), P < 0.001]. However, an additive or synergistic effect of both susceptible genes on relative risk for  SLE was not evident. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that FcgammaRIIa-R/R131 homozygote and HLA-DRB1*15 allele are independent risk factors in Korean SLE patients without additive or synergistic effects.;2001-2003
318;Usefulness of technetium-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion SPECT in detection of cardiovascular involvement in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or systemic sclerosis.;2003;International journal of cardiology;Lin CC;The main purpose of the study was to evaluate the utility of technetium-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT) in detection of cardiac involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or systemic sclerosis (SS) patients. Fifty SLE or SS female patients with cardiac symptom/sign such as chest discomfort and/or dyspnea and/or occasionally palpitation and 50 SLE or SS female patients without any cardiac symptom/sign were investigated using Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT during rest and stress after dipyridamole infusion. Twenty-five age- and sex-matched healthy females were also included as controls in this study. The results of Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT were classified into four types including normal, persistent perfusion defect (PD), reversible perfusion defect (RD), and reverse perfusion defect (RR). The results of Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT in the 25 healthy females were normal. Perfusion abnormalities were detected in 44/50 (88%) symptomatic SLE or SS patients. However, myocardial perfusion abnormalities were only detected in 19/50 (38%) asymptomatic SLE or SS patients (P value<0.05 by a chi2 test). However, for risk factor of coronary artery disease and abnormal resting EKG, the incidences were not significant between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (P  values >0.05 by a chi2 test). Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT is a useful noninvasive imaging modality to detect cardiac involvement in symptomatic or asymptomatic SLE or SS patients.;2001-2003
319;T(H)1/T(H)2 cytokine profile, metalloprotease-9 activity and hormonal status in pregnant rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus patients.;2003;Clinical and experimental immunology;Munoz-Valle JF;During the course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), several immune and neuroendocrine changes associated with pregnancy may exert positive (amelioration) or negative (exacerbation) effects on the clinical  outcome. In order to shed light on the mechanisms underlying these responses, we  performed a prospective longitudinal study in RA and SLE pregnant women, including healthy pregnant women as a control group. Cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) expression assessed by quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), cytokine levels and lymphocyte proliferation responses (LPR) following phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation of PBMC, plasma metalloprotease-9 activity (MMP-9) and hormonal status during pregnancy were determined. TNFa was the most abundant cytokine mRNA expressed in PBMC in all groups studied (healthy pregnant women, RA and SLE pregnant patients). However, a general TH2 response reflected by high IL-10 levels was found in RA, as well as SLE, patients. A significant change in IFN-gamma was observed in RA patients but only during the first trimester of pregnancy. This compared with a major TH1 response in healthy pregnant women. Interestingly, our study showed a homogeneous hormonal pattern in RA and SLE patients. Although decreased cortisol levels were observed in all patients studied, this is possibly related to the remission of disease activity status brought about by steroid treatment before and during pregnancy. In summary, we suggest that complex immune and hormonal networks are involved in pregnancy and that rheumatic diseases are very dynamic immune processes that cannot be described with a clear-cut cytokine profile. Furthermore, the observations in this study may reflect treatment-related immune effects more than those associated with disease.;2001-2003
320;High-dose cyclophosphamide without stem cell transplantation in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2003;Arthritis and rheumatism;Petri M;"OBJECTIVE: High-dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is increasingly being studied as a treatment for severe autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). High-dose cyclophosphamide, the foundation of virtually all conditioning regimens for stem  cell transplantation, is not myeloablative; therefore, when high-dose cyclophosphamide is used alone, autografting, with its potential for reinfusing autoreactive effector cells, is not required. We undertook this study to investigate the safety and efficacy of high-dose cyclophosphamide without stem cell transplantation in refractory SLE. METHODS: We treated 14 patients with moderate-to-severe SLE that had been refractory to corticosteroids and one or more additional immunosuppressive drugs. All patients received 50 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide for 4 consecutive days followed by 5 microg/kg granulocyte colony-stimulating factor until the neutrophil count was 1 x 10(9)/liter for 2 consecutive days. Patients were followed up monthly for disease activity using the physician's global assessment, SLE Disease Activity Index, and assessment of  functioning of involved organs. The Responder Index for Lupus Erythematosus was used to define partial or complete response. RESULTS: The median time to achieve  a neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10(9)/liter was 14 days (range 11-22 days) after the  last dose of cyclophosphamide. Patients required a median of 2 units (range 2-5)  of packed red blood cells, and a median of 16 days (range 0-23 days) elapsed from the last dose of cyclophosphamide to the last platelet transfusion. There were no deaths or fungal infections. Significant improvements in physician's global assessment (mean difference 1.4; P < 0.0001), SLE Disease Activity Index (mean difference 4.1; P = 0.0039), and prednisone dosage (mean difference 14.9 mg/day;  P = 0.002) were observed. Responses, including 5 durable complete responses, were observed in all organ systems (renal, central nervous system, and skin) with involvement that had led to patient enrollment. CONCLUSION: High-dose cyclophosphamide without stem cell transplantation leads to rapid hematopoietic reconstitution and has significant clinical benefit in patients with refractory SLE. Therefore, this approach deserves further study.";2001-2003
321;Assessment of damage in juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: a multicenter cohort study.;2003;Arthritis and rheumatism;Ravelli A;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of cumulative organ damage in patients with juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its association with demographic and clinical variables, medication use, and quality of life. METHODS: The occurrence of organ system damage, as measured by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI), was determined for 387 patients consecutively enrolled in pediatric rheumatology centers from Europe, the US, Mexico, and Japan. Risk factors for damage included demographic variables; clinical manifestations at diagnosis; previous corticosteroid, immunosuppressive, and antimalarial therapies; disease activity; and quality of life. RESULTS: Overall, 195 (50.5%) patients had damage  within a mean of 5.7 years after disease onset. Renal (21.8%) and neuropsychiatric (15.8%) system involvement were observed most frequently, followed by musculoskeletal (11.7%), ocular (10.9%) and skin (9.6%) system involvement, with a mean SDI score of 1.1. In multivariate models, the occurrence of neuropsychiatric manifestations at diagnosis, a longer disease duration, and a greater number of intravenous cyclophosphamide pulses showed the strongest association with the presence of damage. CONCLUSION: We found evidence of cumulative organ damage, as measured by the SDI, in half of the patients with juvenile-onset SLE. Damage was significantly more likely in patients who had experienced neuropsychiatric manifestations at diagnosis, had a longer disease duration, and had received more intravenous pulses of cyclophosphamide.";2001-2003
322;Improvement in health-related quality of life in systemic lupus erythematosus patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing LJP 394 treatment with placebo.;2003;Lupus;Strand V;"In a 76-week, randomized controlled trial, patients received 100 mg LJP 394 or placebo weekly for 16 weeks followed by three 12-week treatment cycles of 50 mg LJP 394 or placebo weekly each separated by eight-week periods when no therapy was administered. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed using SF-36 at baseline, 16 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. Analyses populations included intent to treat (ITT) (n = 179) and patients with high-affinity anti-dsDNA antibody binding (HA): 157/179; 85% active, 90% placebo. In the ITT population, there were improvements in role emotional (RE) (+7.3 versus -8.2), social functioning (SF) (+4.3 versus +0.7), and role physical (RP) (+11.3 versus  +6.0) domains in the active treatment group when compared with placebo, with similar changes observed in the HA population. In 37 patients with data pre- and  post-renal flares, those receiving LJP 394 reported stabilization or improvement  in all but one domain compared with deterioration in all domains with placebo. Changes in RE domain scores following a flare differed by 22.7 points between the two treatment groups, favouring LJP 394 treatment. Patients receiving LJP 394 reported stable or improved HRQOL with active treatment following renal flares compared with deterioration in placebo. Differences between treatment groups in RE and SF domains are clinically important and were replicated irrespective of the protocol population analysed.";2001-2003
323;Fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomized controlled trial of exercise.;2003;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Tench CM;OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of a graded aerobic exercise programme in treating fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus. METHODS: Ninety-three patients  with systemic lupus erythematosus without active disease in any major organ were  randomized, using a minimization protocol, to 12 weeks of graded exercise therapy, relaxation therapy or no intervention. RESULTS: Analysis by intention to treat showed that 16 of the 33 (49%) patients in the exercise group rated themselves as 'much' or 'very much' better compared with eight out of 29 (28%) in the relaxation group and five out of 32 (16%) in the control group (chi2=8.3, df=2, P=0.02). Fatigue improved significantly on one out of three measures after  exercise therapy and there was a trend for fatigue to improve on all measures after exercise. CONCLUSION: These findings support the use of appropriately prescribed graded aerobic exercise in the management of patients with fatigue and systemic lupus erythematosus.;2001-2003
324;HLA-DPB1 alleles association of anticardiolipin and anti-beta2GPI antibodies in a large series of European patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2003;Lupus;Sebastiani GD;Our objective was to determine the HLA-DPB1 allele associations of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2GPI (a(beta)2GPI) antibodies, and of clinical manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We studied 577 European patients with SLE. aCL and a(beta)2GPI antibodies were measured by ELISA. Molecular typing of HLA-DPB1 locus was performed by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide probe (PCR-SSOP) method. aCL showed positive association with -DPB1*1501 (P = 0.005, OR = 7.4), and -DPB1*2301 (P = 0.009, OR = 3.3). a(beta)2GPI showed positive association with -DPB1*0301 (P = 0.01, OR = 1.9), and -DPB1*1901 (P = 0.004, OR = 8.1). In addition, livedo reticularis was associated with -DPB1*1401, and Raynaud's phenomenon with -DPB1*2001. In conclusion, HLA-DPB1 locus may contribute to the genetic predisposition to develop antiphospholipid antibodies and clinical manifestations of the APS in patients with SLE. ;2001-2003
325;Quinacrine added to ongoing therapeutic regimens attenuates anticardiolipin antibody production in SLE.;2003;Lupus;Toubi E;The benefit of combining quinacrine (Qn) with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was previously re-evaluated by us. In our current study we observed that, in 11 active SLE patients (SLEDAI score 5-12), the addition of Qn (100 mg/day) to their existing ongoing therapeutic regimens resulted in a significant attenuation of their previously persistent anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) response. This was in comparison with a matched non-Qn treated control group composed of 14 randomly chosen aCL-positive  SLE patients with a similar SLEDAI score 6-10. Prior to Qn treatment the therapeutic regimens of 12 months' duration, included in all cases HCQ (400 mg/day), in many cases prednisone (P, 10-20 mg/day) and in some additional cases  immunosuppressive drugs. SLEDAI scores and aCL levels were monitored during the entire follow-up period which totaled 24 months in the study group and 15-18 months in the controls. Along with the beneficial effect of the added Qn on SLEDAI scores, aCL disappearance was documented in eight of 11 patients and remained negative during 8-12 months of follow-up (P = 0.004), compared with such a change in only three of 14 non-Qn treated aCL-positive patients (P = 0.18). We  conclude that the added Qn treatment to former established therapeutic protocols  may eliminate aCL response in SLE patients. Whether this agent's effect is permanent needs further elucidation.

326;Anti-dsDNA antibody avidity determination by a simple reliable ELISA method for SLE diagnosis and monitoring.;2003;Lupus;Villalta D;"High avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies are more specific for SLE diagnosis, and more  closely associated with renal involvement than intermediate or low-affinity anti-dsDNA antibodies. ELISA methods are largely used to detect anti-dsDNA, but their high sensitivity is inversely related to specificity because they also detect low avidity antibodies. We developed an ELISA assay based on the law of mass action and the competitive binding of dsDNA in solution and coated to microwells with anti-dsDNA antibodies. A simplified Scatchard plot analysis system was used to measure anti-dsDNA antibody avidity which was expressed as apparent affinity constant (Kaa), and quantified in liters per unit (I/U). We prospectively studied 101 consecutive SLE patients, who were followed for 3 years; three serum samples were sequentially collected from each patient during follow-up for determination of IgG anti-dsDNA antibody concentration, and anti-dsDNA avidity. SLE disease activity was estimated using the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measure (ECLAM) index. Sera from 100 healthy subjects and 133 patients with other connective tissue diseases or infectious diseases were also assayed as controls. The mean Kaa in SLE patients was 65.2 +/- 47.3 l/U, with no variations over time. Anti-dsDNA-positive SLE patients had higher Kaa values (79.1 +/- 46.8) than anti-dsDNA negative patients (27.2 +/- 20.1; P <  0.001). No correlation emerged between anti-dsDNA avidity and the ECLAM activity  index score. Avidity was significantly higher in patients with renal involvement  vs patients without this complication (78.2 +/- 50 vs 59.9 +/- 45.6 l/U; P = 0.0013). This simple ELISA method could be very useful in the diagnostic phase to differentiate high avidity anti-dsDNA autoantibodies that are characteristically  found in SLE patients from low avidity antibodies that can also be found in other inflammatory diseases. Moreover, our data confirm the predictive value of high avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies for the development of lupus nephritis.";2001-2003

328;Clinical and laboratory features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Pakistani patients.;2002;JPMA. The Journal of the Pakistan Medical Association;Ahmed TA;OBJECTIVES: To study the clinico-pathological features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Pakistani patients at the time of presentation in the four teaching hospitals of Rawalpindi-Islamabad area. SETTINGS: Department of Immunology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), Rawalpindi, Military Hospital (MH), Rawalpindi, Armed Forces Institute of Urology (AFIU), Rawalpindi,  Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Rawalpindi, Department of Rheumatology, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Islamabad. SUBJECTS: Patients suffering from SLE, diagnosed on the basis of the ARA criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinico-pathological features at the time of presentation. RESULTS: Twelve male patients in age range 5-30 years (mean 21.6 years) and 38 female patients in age range 8-37 years (mean 22.2 years) were included in the study, showing a female to male ratio of 3:1. Fever was the most common presenting feature (100%), followed by arthralgias/arthritis (98%), malar rash (64%) and oral ulcers (58%). Laboratory results showed antinuclear antibody to be positive  in all patients followed by anti double stranded DNA antibodies (anti DNA antibodies: 64%), anti extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (anti ENA antibodies: 64%) and evidence of complement consumption in 64% of the patients. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) was found to be increased with a mean of 64  mm first hour fall in males and a mean of 87 mm first hour fall in the female patients. The C reactive protein was detected to be normal or marginally increased inspite of the increased ESR with mean of 7 mg/l for male patients and  5 mg/1 for the females. CONCLUSION: The subject patient population presented almost universally with fever and arthralgias or arthritis in combination with malar rash or oral ulcers and in some patients a combination of all of the above  was observed. A combination of positive anti nuclear antibody test, evidence for  consumption of the complement in form of low C4 and C3, increased ESR and low C reactive protein were found to be a sensitive and cost effective set of laboratory findings for the diagnosis of patients suffering from SLE. The above mentioned set of clinical and laboratory features would help in the correct and early diagnosis of patients suffering from SLE, a relatively rare disease, in the busy medical out patient departments in our set up.;2001-2003
329;Transforming growth factor-12 polymorphism and systemic lupus erythematosus.;2002;The Journal of rheumatology;Alansari A;OBJECTIVE: To determine whether transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGF-beta2) gene polymorphism is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility. TGF-beta is a multifunctional family of cytokines important in tissue repair, inflammation and immunoregulation. SLE is thought to be a T cell dependent autoimmune disorder with T cell dysfunction. Due to its known suppressive effects on interleukin 2 dependent T cell growth, TGF-beta2 is considered to be a candidate SLE susceptibility gene. Furthermore, SLE has been linked with a region to which the TGF-beta2 gene has been mapped. METHODS: Association studies were performed in 3 case-control populations, from Spain. Turkey, and UK, using a TGF-beta2 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) 4 base pair (bp) insertion polymorphism. Genotyping was performed using fluorescent labeled polymerase chain reaction product sizing. Results. No significant differences were detected in TGF-beta2 5'-UTR polymorphism allele frequencies between SLE patients and matched controls in the 3 populations studied. CONCLUSION: The 4 bp  insertion polymorphism within the TGF-beta2 gene does not appear to be associated with SLE. However, this does not rule out the possible involvement of TGF-beta2 in the disease pathogenesis.;2001-2003
330;Systemic lupus erythematosus disease severity in men and women: a case-control study.;2002;The Journal of rheumatology;Aranow C;OBJECTIVE: To assess the severity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in men compared to women. METHODS: A validated Lupus Severity of Disease Index (SDI) was used to assess disease severity in a retrospective multicenter case-control study. Each man (n = 18) was matched with 1-3 women (n = 36) for age, disease duration, and clinical setting. Clinical and serologic features were assessed and compared. RESULTS: There was no significant sex difference in disease severity (SDI 4.8 men vs 3.9 women). Comparison of other clinical or serologic manifestations showed that cerebritis, thromboembolic phenomena, and antiphospholipid antibodies were more common in men. CONCLUSION: There is no difference in lupus disease severity between men and women. However, there are sex-specific differences in expression of some disease manifestations.;2001-2003
331;Treatment of severe immune thrombocytopenia associated with systemic lupus erythematosus: 59 cases.;2002;The Journal of rheumatology;Arnal C;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the response to treatment in a large cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) associated with autoimmune thrombocytopenia. METHODS: Response to treatment was assessed retrospectively in  59 patients with SLE, either definite (n = 44) or incomplete (n = 15), associated with frank autoimmune thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count < 50 x 10(9)/l). Response to treatment was classified as complete (CR: platelet count >  150 x 10(9)/l), partial (PR: platelet count > 50 x 10/l), or failure (FR) in the  other cases. RESULTS: Oral prednisone alone was used in 50 of the 59 patients (mean initial dose 1 mg/kg body weight/day). A response was obtained in 80% of cases (CR in 28. PR in 12) but only 11 (22%) had a sustained response (CR, n = 7; PR, n = 4). In contrast, combined treatment with prednisone and either danazol (n = 18) or hydroxychloroquine (n = 11) resulted in 50% (7 CR, 2 PR) and 64% (4 CR,  3 PR) longterm responses, respectively, allowing prednisone to be withdrawn or the dose tapered below 0.2 mg/kg body weight/day. High dose methylprednisolone pulses (n = 10) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (n = 31) resulted in positive responses in 60% (4 CR, 2 PR) and 65% (12 CR, 8 PR) of cases, respectively, but the response was transient in each case. Splenectomy (n = 17) resulted in 65% longterm responses (10 CR, 1 PR). Only 2 longterm partial responses were obtained with the 22 immunosuppressant-containing regimens administered to 14 patients. At the end of the study. a response was observed in  52 (88%) patients [CR: 36 (61%), PR: 16 (27%)], mainly as a result of splenectomy or combined treatment with prednisone and either danazol or hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: Longterm remission was obtained in the majority of patients. The major treatments inducing remission were splenectomy and prednisone combined with danazol or hydroxychloroquine.";2001-2003
332;Systemic lupus erythematosus in three ethnic groups. XII. Risk factors for lupus  nephritis after diagnosis.;2002;Lupus;Bastian HM;"The purpose of this study was to determine the cumulative incidence of lupus nephritis (LN) and the factors predictive of its occurrence in a multiethnic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cohort. We studied 353 SLE patients as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (65 Hispanics, 93 African-Americans and 91 Caucasians). First, we determined the cumulative incidence of LN in all patients. Next, we determined the predictors for LN in those with nephritis occurring after diagnosis. The dependent variable, LN, was defined by: (1) A renal biopsy demonstrating World Health Organization (WHO), class II-V histopathology; and/or (2) proteinuria > or = 0.5 g/24 h or 3+ proteinuria attributable to SLE; and/or (3) one of the following features also attributable to SLE and present on two or more visits, which were performed at least 6 months apart--proteinuria > or = 2+, serum creatinine > or = 1.4 mg/dl, creatinine clearance < or = 79 ml/min, > or = 10 RBCs or WBCs per high power field (hpf), or > or = 3 granular or cellular casts per hpf. Independent variables assessed at diagnosis, and if absent, at baseline, were from four domains: sociodemographic, clinical, immunologic and immunogenetic (including the complete antibody profile and MHC class II alleles), and health habits. Variables with P < 0.05 by chi square analyses were entered into domain-specific stepwise logistic regression analyses controlling for disease duration, with LN as the dependent variable. Significant domain-specific regression variables (P < or = 0.1) were then entered into an overall model. The cumulative incidence of LN was  54.3% in all patients, and 35.3% for those developing LN after diagnosis. LN after diagnosis occurred in 43.1% of 65 Hispanics, 50.5% of 93 African-Americans, and 14.3% of 91 Caucasians, P < 0.0001. The duration of follow-up for those with  LN after diagnosis was 5.5+/-2.4 vs 4.0+/-2.9 years for those without LN. Hispanic (odds ratio (OR) = 2.71, 95% confidence limits (CL) = 1.07-6.87, P < 0.04) and African-American ethnicities (OR = 3.13, 95% CL = 1.21-8.09, P < 0.02), not married or living together (OR = 3.45, 95% CL = 1.69-7.69, P < 0.0003), higher SLAM score (OR = 1.11, 95% CL = 1.02-1.19, P < 0.007), anti-dsDNA (OR = 3.14, 95% CL = 1.50-6.57, P < 0.0001) and anti-RNP (OR = 4.24, CL = 1.98-9.07, P  < 0.0001) antibodies were shown to be significant predictors of the occurrence of LN. Repeated analyses excluding the patients with missing HLA data showed that absence of HLA-DQB1*0201 was also a significant predictor for the occurrence of LN (OR = 2.34, CL = 1.13-5.26, P < 0.04). In conclusion, LN occurred significantly more often in Hispanics and African-Americans with SLE. Sociodemographic, clinical and immunologic/immunogenetic factors seem to be predictive of LN occurring after the diagnosis of SLE has been made.";2001-2003
333;Differences by race, sex and age in the clinical and immunologic features of recently diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus patients in the southeastern United States.;2002;Lupus;Cooper GS;We examined the prevalence of clinical and immunologic features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by race, sex and age in a population-based study of 265 SLE patients. Patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology classification  criteria. The median time between diagnosis and study enrollment was 13 months. The clinical and hematologic data were limited to occurrences up to 6 months after the diagnosis date, as documented in medical records. We used sera collected at study enrollment from 244 (92%) patients for serologic testing of autoantibodies. The associations between clinical and immunological features of SLE and age, sex and race were examined using logistic regression. The effect of  each of these variables was examined adjusting for the other two demographic factors. Mean age at diagnosis was 6 years younger among African-Americans and other minorities compared with white patients (P < 0.01). Discoid lupus, proteinuria, anti-Sm and anti-RNP autoantibodies were more commonly seen in African-American patients, with odds ratios higher than 3.0. Photosensitivity and mucosal ulcers were noted less often in African-American patients. Proteinuria, leukopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia were approximately three times more  common in men compared with women. The prevalence of oral or nasal ulcers and anti-DNA autoantibodies declined with age. The extent to which the differences we observed reflect genetic or environmental influences on the disease process should be investigated.;2001-2003
334;Counterbalancing patient demands with evidence: results from a pan-Canadian randomized clinical trial of brief supportive-expressive group psychotherapy for  women with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2002;Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral;Dobkin PL;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Brief Supportive-Expressive Group Psychotherapy as an adjunct to standard medical care in reducing psychological distress, medical symptoms, and health care costs and improving quality of life in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A randomized clinical  trial was conducted with 133 SLE female patients from 9 clinics across Canada. Clinical and psychosocial measures were taken at baseline, posttreatment, and 6 and 12 months posttreatment. Outcomes assessed were psychological distress, quality of life, disease activity, health service utilization, and diminished productivity. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that there were no clinically important group differences on any of the outcome measures. CONCLUSION: Although both groups improved over time on several measures (e.g., decreases in psychological distress, stress, and emotion-oriented coping), these  changes could not be attributed to the psychotherapeutic intervention. Thus, evidence does not support the referral of these patients to this type of intervention.;2001-2003
335;High-dose cyclophosphamide for severe systemic lupus erythematosus.;2002;Lupus;Gladstone DE;Cytotoxic therapy is a cornerstone for patients with severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). High-dose cyclophosphamide, 200 mg/kg, can induce a complete remission without the need for stem cell rescue in patients with autoimmune illnesses. Here we report on our first four patients treated for severe SLE with  this treatment approach. Patients received cyclophosphamide, 200 mg/kg, divided over 4 days. Starting day 10, patients received filgrastim, 5 micrograms/kg/day,  until their absolute neutrophil count (ANC) rose to 10.0 x 10(9)/l for two consecutive days. Disease activity as evaluated by scores from the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure-2, the SLE Disease Activity Index and the Responder Index for Lupus Erythematosus were completed before and after high-dose therapy. Before high-dose cyclophosphamide, SLE disease duration ranged from 8 to 21 (mean 12.5)  years. Their average disease activity measured by SLAM-2 and SLEDAI was 15.5 (range 11-19) and 23.25 (range 20-26), respectively. At a median of 22 (range 12-39) months of follow-up, mean disease activity measured by SLAM-2 and SLEDAI decreased to 6.25 and 7.75, respectively. All patients experienced febrile neutropenia. No long-term morbidities or mortalities were observed. High dose cyclophosphamide is a therapy capable of decreasing disease severity in poor prognosis SLE patients. Future study is warranted for both refractory patients as well as primary therapy for patients with moderate to severe disease presentations.;2001-2003
336;Predictors of sustained amenorrhea from pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide in premenopausal women with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2002;The Journal of rheumatology;Ioannidis JP;"OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of intravenous cyclophosphamide (IC) induced sustained amenorrhea, especially in young premenopausal women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: The cumulative dose resulting in sustained amenorrhea in 50 and 90% of the treated women (D50 and D90) and predictors of sustained amenorrhea at various ages were determined with Kaplan-Meier plots and  Cox regressions in a consecutively enrolled cohort of 67 premenopausal women with SLE who received a pulsed IC regimen (monthly doses of 0.75-1.00 g/m2) for nephritis (n = 59) or other indications (n = 8). RESULTS: Twenty-one of 67 women  developed sustained amenorrhea of > 12 months' duration. Age was the strongest determinant of this adverse event. For women in the upper age tertile (>or= 32 years old), D50 was 8 g/m2 and D90 was 12 g/m2, and no strong protective or predisposing factors were identified. Conversely, only 5 of 44 women <or= 31 years old at initiation of IC developed sustained amenorrhea. In these young women the risk was modulated by the prior SLE disease duration (risk increased 1.28-fold per year; p = 0.002), the presence of anti-U1RNP antibodies (relative risk 9.5; p = 0.016), and the presence of anti-Ro antibodies (relative risk 13.5; p = 0.021). In multivariate modeling, anti-U1RNP and disease duration were still  significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Sustained amenorrhea is difficult to avoid in women 32 years or older, even with very short IC courses, and alternative regimens should be considered. In younger women treated with a monthly IC regimen, sustained amenorrhea may occur predominantly in those with the recognized adverse predictors of this complication.";2001-2003
337;Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus by inhibition of T cell costimulation with anti-CD154: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.;2002;Arthritis and rheumatism;Kalunian KC;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD154 (IDEC-131) in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: In this phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-center, multiple-dose study, 85 patients with mild-to-moderately active  SLE were randomized to receive 6 infusions of IDEC-131, ranging from 2.5 mg/kg to 10.0 mg/kg, or placebo over 16 weeks. Efficacy was assessed at week 20, primarily by the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and secondarily, by multiple measures of disease activity. Safety was assessed through week 28 by clinical and laboratory evaluation. Immunogenicity studies were also performed. RESULTS: SLEDAI scores improved from the baseline levels of  disease activity in all groups, including the placebo group. However, these scores were not statistically different among the IDEC-131 treatment and placebo  groups at week 20. Evaluations of secondary variables did not indicate significant differences between the IDEC-131 treatment and placebo groups. The type and frequency of adverse events were similar between the IDEC-131 and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: IDEC-131 administered at doses ranging 2.5-10.0 mg/kg over 16 weeks was safe and well tolerated in patients with SLE. Efficacy of the drug compared with placebo was not demonstrated. There were statistically significant improvements from baseline in all groups, including the placebo group.;2001-2003
338;Mycophenolate mofetil for systemic lupus erythematosus refractory to other immunosuppressive agents.;2002;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Karim MY;BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressive drug widely used  in solid organ transplantation, and it may play an increasing role in autoimmune  disease. MMF has been introduced as a novel immunosuppressive agent in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), often in patients intolerant of or resistant to conventional immunosuppressive regimens. METHODS: We studied 21 patients with SLE, most of whom had previously received courses of cyclophosphamide therapy and had also received courses of azathioprine or methotrexate. Indications for treatment included uncontrolled disease activity and worsening renal involvement. RESULTS: MMF treatment resulted in reduced disease activity, as assessed by the SLEDAI (SLE disease activity index) (P=0.0001) and decreased proteinuria (P=0.027) while allowing a significant reduction in oral corticosteroid dose (P=0.0001). Levels of complement factors C3 and C4 and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were not significantly affected. CONCLUSION: MMF appears to be a safe  and effective alternative immunosuppressant for extra-renal and renal disease in  SLE not responding to conventional immunosuppressive treatment.;2001-2003
339;Dehydroepiandrosterone treatment of women with mild-to-moderate systemic lupus erythematosus: a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.;2002;Arthritis and rheumatism;Chang DM;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) at a dosage of 200 mg/day in adult women with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: In a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 120 adult women with active SLE received oral DHEA (200 mg/day; n = 61) or placebo (n = 59) for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the mean change from baseline in the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM) score at  24 weeks of therapy. Secondary end points included time to first flare, change in SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, and physician's and patient's global assessment scores at week 24. RESULTS: The two groups were well balanced for baseline characteristics. Mean reductions in SLAM scores from baseline were similar and were not statistically significantly different between treatment groups (DHEA -2.6 +/- 3.4 versus placebo -2.0 +/- 3.8, mean +/- SD). The number of patients with flares was decreased by 16% in the DHEA group (18.3% of DHEA-treated patients versus 33.9% of placebo-treated patients; P = 0.044, based  on time to first flare). The mean change in the patient's global assessment was statistically significant between the two groups (DHEA -5.5 versus placebo 5.4; P = 0.005). The number of patients with serious adverse events, most of which were  related to SLE flare, was significantly lower in DHEA-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients (P = 0.010). Expected hormonal effects, including increased testosterone levels and increased incidence of acne, were observed. No  life-threatening reactions or serious safety issues were identified during this study. CONCLUSION: The overall results confirm that DHEA treatment was well-tolerated, significantly reduced the number of SLE flares, and improved patient's global assessment of disease activity.

Indirect study of cellular immunity.;2002;Lupus;Pascual-Ramos V;"Cutaneous anergy in SLE patients results from disease activity and/or immunosuppressive treatment (IT). The aim of this study was to evaluate purified  protein derivative (PPD) reaction in SLE patients. A total of 145 patients and 20 controls were studied. Five units of PPD were applied on day 0, and skin reaction was measured after 3 (PPD1) and 6 (PPD2) days. A booster was applied (day 14), and the reaction was measured after 3 (PPD3) and 6 (PPD4) days. Non-parametric ANOVA test and unpaired Student's t-test were performed. Forty patients (group I) were inactive (MexSLEDAI < 3), receiving no IT (at least 3 months previous to the PPD test); 39 (group II) were inactive receiving IT; 24 (group III) were active without IT, and 42 (group IV) were active with IT. Active patients had lower PPD1 (group III, 1.4 +/- 0.9; group IV, 0.6 +/- 0.5) than inactive patients (group I,  8.4 +/- 2.3; group II, 5.1 +/- 1.9) and than controls (9.4 +/- 3; P < or = 0.001). Group IV had lower delayed response (PPD2 = 0.3 +/- 0.3) than inactive groups (group I, 2.6 +/- 0.9; group II, 3.1 +/- 0.8) and than controls (7.9 +/- 2.5; P < or = 0.001). Group III had lower delayed reaction (PPD2 = 1.2 +/- 0.8) than controls (P < or = 0.001). Active SLE patients, receiving or not receiving IT, had lower skin response to PPD than inactive patients and controls.";2001-2003
342;Effects of prasterone on corticosteroid requirements of women with systemic lupus erythematosus: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.;2002;Arthritis and rheumatism;Petri MA;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether treatment with prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone  [DHEA]) would allow the dosage of prednisone (or an equivalent corticosteroid) to be reduced to < or = 7.5 mg/day for 2 months or longer while maintaining stable or reduced disease activity in steroid-dependent women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized trial, 191 female SLE patients receiving prednisone (10-30 mg/day) were treated daily with either placebo, 100 mg of oral prasterone (an adrenal androgen), or 200 mg of oral prasterone for 7-9-months. At monthly intervals, corticosteroid dosages were reduced by algorithm in patients whose SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score  was stable or improved. Patients for whom a sustained reduction in the dosage of  prednisone (< or = 7.5 mg/day) was achieved for at least the last 2 months of the 7-9-month treatment period were classified as responders. RESULTS: Response rates were 41% in the placebo group, 44% in the 100-mg prasterone group, and 55% in the 200-mg group (P = 0.110, 200 mg versus placebo). Among the 137 subjects (45 in the placebo group, 47 in the 100-mg group, and 45 in the 200-mg group) who had active disease at baseline (defined as SLEDAI score >2), 29%, 38%, and 51%, respectively, were responders (P = 0.031 for 200 mg prasterone versus placebo). Acne was the most common adverse event but was generally mild. Clinical and laboratory changes primarily reflected androgenic effects of prasterone. CONCLUSION: Among women with lupus disease activity, reducing the dosage of prednisone to < or = 7.5 mg/day for a sustained period of time while maintaining  stabilization or a reduction of disease activity was possible in a significantly  greater proportion of patients treated with oral prasterone, 200 mg once daily, compared with patients treated with placebo.;2001-2003
343;Effect of a culturally sensitive cholesterol lowering diet program on lipid and lipoproteins, body weight, nutrient intakes, and quality of life in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2002;The Journal of rheumatology;Shah M;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a culturally sensitive cholesterol lowering  diet program on lipid and lipoproteins, body weight, nutrient intakes, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHOD: Seventeen patients with SLE were randomized to a Step 2 diet intervention group or a control group for 12 weeks. The diet intervention was made up of weekly group sessions during the first 6 weeks followed by telephone counseling every 2 weeks for the last 6 weeks. Data on fasting lipid and lipoproteins, body  weight, food intake (3 day food record), and QOL were collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Program acceptability was assessed in the diet group at 6 weeks. RESULTS: The intervention was found to be highly acceptable and culturally sensitive. The changes in nutrient intakes at 6 and 12 weeks in the diet group were -49% and -33%, respectively, for cholesterol, -44% and -32%, respectively, for percentage calories from fat, and -46% and -32%, respectively, for percentage calories from saturated fat. The corresponding figures in the control group were  +22% and -8% for cholesterol, +9% and +6% for percentage calories from fat, and +5% and +7% for percentage calories from saturated fat. The treatment by time interaction was significant for all the dietary variables (p = 0.0003 to 0.02). QOL was reported to improve by 15-17% in the diet group and decrease by 4-6% in the control group, and the treatment by time interaction was significant (p = 0.05). The changes in the physiological variables at 6 and 12 weeks in the diet group were -10% and -6%, respectively, for total cholesterol, -10% and -2%, respectively, for low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, -11% and -4%, respectively, for high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, -25% and -34%, respectively, for very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, -8% and -24%,  respectively, for triglycerides, and -2% and -5%, respectively, for body weight.  The corresponding figures in the control group were -5% and -3% for total cholesterol, -6% and -5% for LDL cholesterol, 0% and +12% for HDL cholesterol, +4% and -8% for VLDL cholesterol, -6% and -15% for triglycerides, and -5% and -6% for body weight. The treatment by time interaction was significant for HDL cholesterol (p = 0.04). A significant reduction was seen in the diet group for total cholesterol at 6 and 12 weeks, LDL and HDL cholesterol at 6 weeks, and body weight at 12 weeks (p = 0.0002 to 0.01). CONCLUSION: This culturally sensitive cholesterol reducing diet program was highly accepted and effective in changing the diet and QOL of patients with SLE. The effect on serum lipids, lipoproteins,  and body weight, however, was modest. A larger randomized study with a longer intervention period is necessary to test the effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering diet on lipids and lipoproteins in patients with SLE.;2001-2003
344;No short-term immunological effects of Pneumococcus vaccination in patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus.;2002;Scandinavian journal of rheumatology;Tarjan P;OBJECTIVE: to investigate the early immunological effects of Pneumococcus vaccination in SLE patients and healthy controls. METHODS: First-four-week follow-up of 18 patients and 9 healthy controls by repeated measurements of anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-dsDNA, C-reactive protein, complement factor 3 (C3) and 4 (C4), total IgG, IgA and IgM. Specific antibody response, percentage of blood lymphocyte populations and whole blood chemiluminescence measurements were  carried out in six patients and six controls. RESULTS: No disease flare was detected in the vaccinated patients. all side effects were mild. The concentrations of serum IgG, IgA, C3 and C4 decreased significantly, but still remained within the normal range. The other changes were statistically non-significant. The specific antibody responses to 6B and 23F Pneumococcus serotypes showed striking individual differences. CONCLUSION: There was no short-term immunological effect of Pneumococcus vaccination in the patients with  SLE. The non-responders. without any sign of disease activation should possibly be given more immunogenic, new vaccines to avoid life-threatening Pneumococcus infections.;2001-2003
345;Aerobic fitness, fatigue, and physical disability in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2002;The Journal of rheumatology;Tench C;"OBJECTIVE: To measure aerobic fitness, muscle strength, fatigue, and physical disability in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Ninety-three patients with SLE and 41 sedentary controls were recruited into the  study. Aerobic fitness was assessed by monitoring peak and submaximal oxygen uptake, heart rate, duration of exercise, and perceived exertion during a treadmill-walking test. Strength was measured using voluntary isometric quadriceps contraction. Symptomatic measures included physical and mental fatigue, mood, sleep, and functional incapacity. RESULTS: Compared to sedentary controls patients with SLE had significantly reduced levels of aerobic fitness (mean VO2peak SLE patients, 23.2 ml/kg/min vs controls, 29.6 ml/kg/min; p < 0.001) and reduced exercise capacity (mean exercise duration SLE patients, 10.4 min vs controls, 13.1 min; p < 0.001). The SLE patients also had reduced muscle strength (mean maximum voluntary quadriceps contraction SLE patients, 298 N vs controls, 376 N; p = 0.003). Resting lung function was also significantly worse in the SLE patients (mean FEV, SLE patients, 2.6 l vs controls, 2.9 l; p = 0.002). Fatigue (p < 0.001), depressed mood (p < 0.001), poor sleep quality (p <  0.001), and functional incapacity (p < 0.001) were all significantly greater in the SLE patients. Linear regression models suggested that physical disability correlated with aerobic fitness (p < 0.001), fatigue (p = 0.005), body mass index (p = 0.01), and depression (p = 0.05) and that fatigue correlated with depression (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with SLE were less fit with reduced exercise capacity, reduced muscle strength, more fatigue, and greater disability compared  to sedentary controls. Treatments developed to manage depression and improve aerobic fitness should be considered in the overall treatment of fatigue and disability in SLE.";2001-2003
346;Evaluation of lipid profile, macular toxicity and clinical manifestations according to APO E genotype in systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with chloroquine.;2002;Scandinavian journal of rheumatology;Vazquez-Del Mercado M;OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of APO E gene polymorphism over lipid profile, macular toxicity and clinical manifestations in RA and SLE patients treated with chloroquine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 45 RA and 29 SLE patients treated with chloroquine who were classified based on the therapeutic regime of chloroquine into three groups: A) Cumulative dose of 100-300 g, B) >300 g and C) Never received chloroquine. Clinical evaluation, fasting lipid profile,  visual field testing and stereoscopic photos of the retina were performed. APO E  genotype was determined by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Reduced apo B levels in RA and SLE  according to the cumulative dose of chloroquine 2/3 APO E genotype in a subset of SLE patients were observed. Macular toxicity was independent of both APO E genotype and cumulative chloroquine dose. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced apo B levels were  observed associated to chloroquine treatment and 2/3 APO E genotype.;2001-2003
347;Serum levels of angiogenic cytokines in systemic lupus erythematosus and their correlation with disease activity.;2001;European cytokine network;Robak E;"We investigated the serum concentration of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)  and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a group of 60 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and 20 healthy controls. We also examined the possible association between the serum concentrations of these factors and certain clinical, laboratory parameters and SLE activity. HGF, VEGF and TGF-beta1 were detectable in all patients with SLE, and in all normal individuals. bFGF was measurable in 70% of the patients with SLE and in 65% of the healthy controls. The HGF level was higher in active SLE (median 1,019.5pg/ml) than in inactive SLE (median 787.8 pg/ml) (p < 0.005) or in the control group (median 847.0 pg/ml) (p  < 0.009). The level of VEGF in active SLE was also higher (203.5 pg/ml) than in inactive disease (116.1 pg/ml) (p < 0.05) or in healthy persons (133.5 pg/ml) (p  < 0.04). The levels of bFGF and TGF-beta1 were similar for both the active and inactive SLE, and the control group (p > 0.05). We found a significant, positive  correlation between the levels of HGF and bFGF (r = 0.268, p < 0.04), HGF and TGF-beta1 (r = 0.365, p < 0.005) and HGF and VEGF (r = 0.327, p < 0.02) as well as VEGF and TGF-beta1 (r = 0.543, p < 0.001). We found a positive correlation between VEGF serum levels and platelet counts (r = 0.272, p < 0.04), and the TGF-beta1 concentration and platelet count (r = 0.313; p < 0.02). There was also  a positive correlation between HGF serum concentration and the SLE activity score (r = 0.435, p < 0.001), as well as between the level of VEGF and SLE activity (r  = 0.252, p = 0.05). In conclusion, serum levels of the angiogenic factors HGF and VEGF may be relevant in SLE pathogenesis. Their concentrations seem to be markers of SLE activity. ";2001-2003
348;The association of the HLA class II antigens with clinical and autoantibody expression in Malaysian Chinese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2001;Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology / launched by the Allergy and;Azizah MR;The frequency of the HLA class II antigens/alleles (HLA-DR, DQ and DP) were studied in 70 Malaysian Chinese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  to examine the contribution of these genes to disease susceptibility, their clinical expression and Immunological responses. This was done using modified PCR-RFLP technique. These samples were then compared with 66 ethnically matched controls. We found a strong association of the DQA1*0102 (p corr = 0.032, rr = 3.39), DQB1*0501 (p corr = 0.003, rr = 4.55), *0601 (p corr = 0.006, rr = 4.22) and DPB1* 0901(p corr = 0.02, rr = 4.58) with SLE. Clinically, we found a strong  association of DR2 and DQA1*0301 with renal involvement and DQA1*0102 with alopecia. Immunologically, statistical analysis (Chi-square test ) showed a strong association of DQA1*0102 with anti-Ro/La antibodies while DQA1*0301 was observed to be strongly associated with antibodies to ds DNA. DQA1*0102 was found more frequently in those with a later disease onset (30 years of age or above). From these data we suggest that the HLA class II genes play a role in conferring  disease susceptibility and clinical and immunological expression.;2001-2003
349;HLA antigens in Malay patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: association with clinical and autoantibody expression.;2001;The Korean journal of internal medicine;Azizah MR;BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that certain genes within the major histocompatibility complex predispose to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and may influence clinical and autoantibody expression. Thus, we studied the frequency of HLA-DR, -DQA, -DQB and -DPB alleles in ethnic Malays with SLE to determine the role of these genes in determining disease susceptibility and their association with clinical and immunological manifestations. METHODS: Fifty-six Malay SLE patients were enrolled into the study. Demographic, clinical and immunological findings were obtained from medical records. HLA-DR, DQ and DP typing were done using modified PCR-RELP. Controls were from ethnically-matched healthy individuals. RESULTS: We found a strongly significant association of the  DR2 and DQB1 *0501 and DQB1*0601 (pcorr = 0.03, rr = 3.83, pcorr = 0.0036, rr = 4.56 and pcorr = 0.0048 and rr = 6.0, respectively). There was also a weak increase of DQB1*0.201 and DPB1*0.0901 with a weak decrease of DQA1*0601 and DQB1*0503 and *0301 which were not significant after corrections for multiple comparisons were made. There was a significant positive association of DR2 and DQB1*0501 with renal involvement and DR8 with alopecia. A nonsignificant increase of DQB1*0503 in patients with photosensitivity was noted. Significant autoantibody associations were also found: DQB1*0601 with anti-Sm/RNP, DR2 with antiSSA (Ro)/SSB (La), and DR2, DQB1*0501 and *0601 with antibodies to ds DNA. There was no specific DR, DQ or DP associations with age of disease onset (below  30 years or those at or above 30 years). CONCLUSION: Our data suggests the role of the HLA class II genes in conferring SLE susceptibility and in clinical and autoantibody expression.;2001-2003
350;Variable effects of social support by race, economic status, and disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2001;The Journal of rheumatology;Bae SC;OBJECTIVE: Health status and disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other chronic diseases are strongly associated with social support, which suggests that enhanced social support in medical care might improve SLE outcome. There has been little or no study on identifying patients for whom social support would be most beneficial. It would allow practitioners to enable social support more effectively as a complement to disease management. METHODS: A retrospective cohort (200 patients with SLE from 5 centers), balanced  by race and insurance status, was studied in a cross sectional design. Demographic, clinical, socioeconomic, and psychosocial factors and disease outcomes [Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM), Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR), SF-36] were measured. Using multivariate linear regression and ANOVA (outcome = SF-36 physical function, mental health), we examined the interaction between social support and patients' characteristics, including race, age, income, occupation, insurance, employment, education, and social network, and characteristics of the  disease itself such as disease activity (SLAM) at diagnosis, damage (SLICC/ACR) at diagnosis, and comorbidity. RESULTS: In multivariate models, higher social support was significantly associated (p < 0.05) with better physical function when respondents were white, had income above poverty level, had Medicare or private insurance (vs Medicaid or no insurance), and had low disease activity at  diagnosis. Social support was associated with better mental health, although there was no significant interaction between social support and other predictors  of mental health. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that social support is beneficial  for mental health for all groups, but has the greatest opportunity for influence  among those already possessing social, economic, and health advantages.;2001-2003
351;Reliability and validity of systemic lupus activity measure-revised (SLAM-R) for  measuring clinical disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2001;Lupus;Bae SC;New clinical scales for semiquantitating disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are widely used in research. They are reliable and valid measures. One of the original scales, the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM), has been modified based on experience with it in multi-observer studies and training of individuals in its use. We tested the psychometric properties of the  revised SLAM (SLAM-R). SLAM-R was tested on 30 SLE patients, who fulfilled 1997 revised ACR criteria and were selected to represent a range of disease activity.  The patients were evaluated independently by two physicians, who studied the instruction booklet and who had never used SLAM-R, on two occasions 2-4 weeks apart. At the first visit, the physician's global assessment of activity using visual analog scale, anti-dsDNA Ab, C3 and C4 were checked for construct validity. The psychometric properties were analyzed with nested analysis of variance and Pearson's correlation coefficient using SAS. All patients were female, the median age was 31 (15-52) y, and the mean score of SLAM-R was 10.5 +/- 5.3 (3-26). Estimates of reliability were 0.78 of inter-rater, 0.61 of inter-visit, 0.76 of physician 1 between visits, and 0.56 of physician 2 between  visits. Among subcategories except 'Eye,' the 'Gastrointestinal' category had the highest (0.96) and the 'Neuromotor' category had the lowest inter-rater reliability (0.50). With respect to construct validity, the correlation of SLAM-R scores with the disease activity variables except C4 was high and statistically significant. In conclusion, the SLAM-R is reliable and valid for measuring clinical disease activity in SLE.;2001-2003
352;Mycophenolate mofetil treatment of severe renal disease in pediatric onset systemic lupus erythematosus.;2001;The Journal of rheumatology;Buratti S;OBJECTIVE: To report the first clinical experience with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, CellCept) in: children with lupus nephritis. METHODS: Eleven children with  various forms of lupus nephritis were treated with oral MMF at a mean dose of 22  mg/kg/day (range 17-42) for a mean of 9.8 months (range 3-17). All children received concomitant prednisone and 7/11 were taking concomitant hydroxychloroquine. Indications for MMF included treatment refractory nephritis despite high dose oral or IV prednisone, azathioprine, and/or cyclophosphamide. Treatment outcome was monitored through assessment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, renal function, and serologic markers such as complement and anti dsDNA antibodies. RESULTS: While renal function normalized in 4/4 patients with membranous glomerulonephritis, little effect was observed in children with proliferative glomerulonephritis. Ten children experienced a marked reduction in SLEDAI score. Anti-dsDNA antibody and  serum complement levels improved or remained stable in 80% of the children. Concomitant prednisone was decreased in 6/11 patients (55%) without deterioration of renal function. Adverse events, observed in 8 patients (73%), were not dose dependent, and included infections, leukopenia, nausea, pruritus, headache, and fatigue. CONCLUSION: MMF may represent a valuable alternative to traditional cytotoxic agents for children with class V lupus nephritis, but was less effective in attenuating disease progression in class IV glomerulonephritis. MMF  had a steroid sparing effect and appeared to be effective in controlling serologic disease activity in pediatric onset SLE. Adverse events such as infections may limit its use and remain a concern.;2001-2003
353;Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus with LJP 394.;2001;The Journal of rheumatology;Furie RA;OBJECTIVE: LJP 394 is a novel therapy under development for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We investigated the optimal LJP 394 dosing regimen required to maximally reduce serum dsDNA antibodies. We also evaluated the safety and tolerability of repeated doses of LJP 394 as well as the effects of therapy on SLE related disease activity and health related quality of life. METHODS: This was a multicenter, partially randomized, placebo controlled, double blind, dose-ranging trial. Study drug or placebo was administered at weekly, biweekly, or monthly intervals for a total of 17, 9, or 5 doses, respectively. Fifty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive 1, 10, or 50 mg LJP 394 or placebo. After a 2 month pretreatment period, dosing visits continued for 16 weeks, after which there was a 2 month posttreatment period. RESULTS: The greatest reductions in mean dsDNA antibody titers were observed in the group of patients who received 50 mg LJP 394 weekly (38.1% and 37.1 % at Weeks 16 and 24,  respectively). A reduction (29.3%) in dsDNA antibody titers was also observed at  Week 24 in the group of patients who received 10 mg LJP 394 weekly. The frequencies of adverse events were comparable in the placebo and active treatment groups. CONCLUSION: This clinical trial, in which a large number of patients with SLE were treated with LJP 394, expanded the safety profile of LJP 394 and demonstrated its capacity to reduce dsDNA antibodies. ;2001-2003
354;Phase I clinical trial of a monoclonal antibody against CD40-ligand (IDEC-131) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2001;The Journal of rheumatology;Davis JC Jr;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and pharmacology of a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD40-ligand (IDEC-131) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Cohorts of 3 to 5 patients with symptomatic lupus each received 0.05, 0.25, 1.0, 5.0, or 15.0 mg/kg of IDEC-131 as a single intravenous infusion. Patients were followed for 3 months to evaluate toxicity and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: This phase I, single dose, dose-escalating study was conducted in 23 patients at a single institution. All patients experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE) during a 3 month followup period, although 58 AE in 17 patients were considered possibly or probably related or of unknown relationship  to treatment. No dose relationship in the distribution of AE was apparent. No infusion related cytokine-release syndrome was observed; no infusions were interrupted, and all patients completed treatment. Eight mild (grade 1 or 2) infections were reported in 8 patients. All infections were considered unrelated  to drug administration and all resolved uneventfully. No patient developed detectable antibodies to IDEC-131. Flow cytometry revealed no apparent treatment  related depletion of lymphocyte subsets. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that  the maximum serum concentration and the area under the concentration curve of IDEC-131 were proportional to the dose administered. At doses between 1.0 and 15.0 mg/kg, the serum half-life ranged from 299 to 320 h. Efficacy was not formally evaluated in this single dose study. CONCLUSION: IDEC-131 (humanized Mab against CD40L) administered in a single intravenous infusion at doses of 0.05-15.0 mg/kg is safe and well tolerated in patients with SLE.";2001-2003
355;Effects of dexamethasone on the expression of Fas molecules and apoptosis of lymphocytes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2001;Immunological investigations;Ho CY;"Previous studies have shown that the autoimmune phenomenon could be caused by defective apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes. Corticosteroids used for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are potent apoptosis inducers. We examined dexamethasone (DEX)-induced apoptosis and Fas expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes of SLE patients and normal subjects. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained from 40 SLE patients and 18 sex- and age-matched control subjects. Percentages of apoptosis and expression of Fas molecule in lymphocytes were assessed by flow cytometry. Fas expression in lymphocytes treated with or without DEX was significantly higher in SLE patients than normal  controls [median (interquartile range) of mean fluorescence intensity without DEX: 74.9 (50.7-98.0) vs 20.0 (17.7-25.0), p < 0.001; with DEX: 77.9 (56.0-130.5) vs 20.5 (18.6-24.7), p<0.001]. DEX (0.1-5 microM) could also induce apoptosis of  lymphocytes from SLE and control subjects in a dose-dependent manner. Elevation of apoptotic susceptibility was more prominent in DEX-treated SLE lymphocytes [33.9% (24.7-37.5%) vs 19.6% (13.6-26.1 %), p = 0.003]. The higher apoptotic susceptibility of SLE lymphocytes upon DEX treatment in vitro may be related, at  least partly, to the pharmacological action of corticosteroids.";2001-2003
356;Selected serum cytokines in systemic lupus erythematosus treated with quinagolide.;2001;Lupus;Hrycek A;The objective of this study was to determine the effect of quinagolide (Norprolac) on serum level of cytokines in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. In 20 SLE patients treated with a low dose of quinagolide, and in 17 healthy persons who constituted the control group, concentration of serum prolactin (PRL), interleukins (ILs), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors (sTNF Rs) preceded by calculation of disease activity index (SLEDAI) were tested  at entry and then after 3 months in 16 patients and after 6 months in 11 patients who completed the study. Serum PRL level was higher (though insignificantly) in the SLE group than in the controls and decreased significantly after 6 months of  therapy. A raised SLEDAI score at entry was significantly reduced during therapy  but a weak correlation with PRL level was revealed. A significant increase in IL-6 level in SLE group as compared to controls was observed (respectively 14.57  +/- 13.25 and 5.04 +/- 3.35 microg/ml) as well as a significantly decreased level after 6 months of treatment (4.30 +/- 2.51 pg/ml). There was a significant difference between sTNF RI concentration before and after 3 months of quinagolide treatment (respectively 1140.83 +/- 312.08 and 1454.58 +/- 465.54 pg/ml). After 6 months of treatment a statistically significant correlation between concentration of PRL and level of IL-6 and a negative correlation between PRL and sTNF RI was revealed. Quinagolide treatment may have a role in the management of SLE patients.;2001-2003
357;Fas promoter -670 polymorphism is associated with development of anti-RNP antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2001;The Journal of rheumatology;Lee YH;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the polymorphism of Fas promoter -670 is associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and their clinical features. METHODS: A polymerase chain reaction of a genomic DNA-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to determine genotypes of the Fas promoter -670 in 87 patients with SLE, 87 with  RA, and 87 healthy controls. A second cohort of SLE patients (n = 85) was included. Clinical manifestations were analyzed in each patient and correlated with the genotypes. RESULTS: The genotype distribution of the Fas promoter -670 did not differ between patients with SLE and control subjects (AA, GA, GG genotypes 31, 54, 15% vs 30, 55, 15% controls, respectively; chi-squared = 0.03,  2 df, p = 0.99) and between RA patients and controls (AA, GA, GG genotypes 38, 44, 18% vs 30, 55, 15% controls, respectively; chi-squared = 2.30, 2 df, p = 0.32). Regarding the clinical status of lupus patients according to Fas promoter  -670 genotypes, there was no significant difference in age at onset, anti-dsDNA titer, C3, C4 level, renal involvement, number of American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria met, SLE Disease Activity Index, SLE International Collaborating Clinics/ACR Damage Index, or autoantibody profiles. However, the frequency of anti-RNP antibody was significantly different in the AA, GA, and GG  groups (71, 25, 30%; chi-squared = 13.29, 2 df, p = 0.001). To confirm this finding, the Fas promoter -670 genotype was examined in a second cohort of SLE patients (n = 85). The result in the second cohort replicated the association shown in the first. In patients with RA, there was no significant difference in clinical and laboratory findings according to the Fas promoter -670 genotypes. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the Fas promoter -670 polymorphism is associated with development of anti-RNP antibodies in SLE.";2001-2003
358;Acquired activated protein C resistance is associated with lupus anticoagulants and thrombotic events in pediatric patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2001;Blood;Male C;"Acquired activated protein C resistance (APCR) has been hypothesized as a possible mechanism by which antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs) cause thrombotic  events (TEs). However, available evidence for an association of acquired APCR with APLAs is limited. More importantly, an association of acquired APCR with TEs has not been demonstrated. The objective of the study was to determine, in pediatric patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), whether (1) acquired  APCR is associated with the presence of APLAs, (2) APCR is associated with TEs, and (3) there is an interaction between APCR and APLAs in association with TEs. A cross-sectional cohort study of 59 consecutive, nonselected children with SLE was conducted. Primary clinical outcomes were symptomatic TEs, confirmed by objective radiographic tests. Laboratory testing included lupus anticoagulants (LAs), anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLAs), APC ratio, protein S, protein C, and factor V Leiden. The results revealed that TEs occurred in 10 (17%) of 59 patients. Acquired APCR was present in 18 (31%) of 58 patients. Acquired APCR was significantly associated with the presence of LAs but not ACLAs. Acquired APCR was also significantly associated with TEs. There was significant interaction between APCR and LAs in the association with TEs. Presence of both APCR and LAs was associated with the highest risk of a TE. Protein S and protein C concentrations were not associated with the presence of APLAs, APCR, or TEs. Presence of acquired APCR is a marker identifying LA-positive patients at high risk of TEs. Acquired APCR may reflect interference of LAs with the protein C pathway that may represent a mechanism of LA-associated TEs.

359;Indole-3-carbinol in women with SLE: effect on estrogen metabolism and disease activity.;2001;Lupus;McAlindon TE;"Estrogen metabolism in women with SLE is weighted towards 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, an estrogenic compound that might fuel disease activity. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C)  is a nutritional compound that can shift estrogen metabolism towards less estrogenic metabolites. However, the effects of I3C in women with SLE have not been studied. Open-label 1-week metabolic study of 375 mg/day I3C was carried out in women with SLE, followed by a 3-month observational period for disease activity. The primary outcome measure was the change in ratio of urinary 2:16alpha hydroxyestrone levels. Secondary measures included the SLE Disease Activity Index. Seventeen clinically premenopausal women fulfilling ACR criteria  for probable/definite SLE (mean age 37.9 y, range 20-49 y, mean disease duration  4.3 y, range 0.5-15) completed the 1-week metabolic study; 12 took I3C for 3 months. The mean 2:16alpha hydroxyestrone ratio increased by 1.84 to 3.15 (P = 0.0001). Mean SLEDAI scores were 10.0 (baseline); 6.25 (3 months); and 8.8 (3 months after withdrawal; P = NS). Women with SLE can manifest a metabolic response to I3C and might benefit from its antiestrogenic effects. We did not observe any striking effects on SLE disease activity during the 3-month observational period.";2001-2003
360;Prevalence and pattern of cognitive impairment in systemic lupus erythematosus patients with and without overt neuropsychiatric manifestations.;2001;Journal of the neurological sciences;Monastero R;The prevalence and pattern of cognitive impairment in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with (NPSLE) and without (nSLE) overt neuropsychiatric manifestations were investigated. Fifty-two nSLE patients, 23 NPSLE patients and 27 healthy controls were evaluated with a battery of standardized neuropsychological and psychological tests. Disease duration, disease activity index, and current corticosteroid therapy were collected. Cognitive impairment was identified in 14 (26.9%) and in 12 (52.2%) of subjects with nSLE and NPSLE, respectively. Both SLE groups showed a significant impairment compared with controls on tasks assessing verbal and non-verbal long-term memory, and visuoconstructional abilities. In addition, NPSLE patients  reported worse performances than both nSLE patients and controls on task evaluating short-term visuospatial memory. NPSLE subjects were significantly more anxious and depressed compared to both nSLE subjects and controls. By multivariate analysis, only depression levels, among clinical variables, significantly predicted cognitive performance. This study shows that cognitive impairment occurs frequently in both nSLE and NPSLE subjects. The higher frequency in NPSLE may be related to coexisting depressive disturbances.;2001-2003
361;UVA-1 cold light treatment of SLE: a double blind, placebo controlled crossover trial.;2001;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Polderman MC;OBJECTIVE: Treatment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) often implies strong drugs with possibly serious side effects. Thus there is a need for new immunosuppressive treatments. Long wave ultraviolet A (UVA-1) cold light therapy is an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory treatment with a possible systemic effect and few side effects. In the current study low dose UVA-1 cold light treatment was tested to determine whether it reduces disease activity in SLE. METHODS: Eleven patients with SLE were treated with UVA-1 cold light treatment and a placebo light treatment in a double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study. In two consecutive 12 week periods the patients were treated in  the first three weeks with UVA-1 and placebo treatment or vice versa. The primary variables were the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and SLE Activity Measure (SLAM). RESULTS: The mean SLAM and SLEDAI showed a significant decrease of 30.4%  (p=0.0005) and 37.9% (p=0.016) respectively after three weeks of UVA-1 and a non-significant decline of 9.3% (p=0.43) and 12.2% (p=0.54) respectively after three weeks of placebo treatment. In this small trial the difference in reduction of the disease activity indices during UVA-1 compared with during placebo treatment failed to reach the conventional border of significance (p=0.07). The total score of quality of life measure RAND-36 did not improve significantly, but the subscore for vitality did improve. CONCLUSION: Low dose UVA-1 cold light treatment was strongly suggestive of lowering disease activity in this double blind placebo controlled study, and no side effects occurred.;2001-2003
362;Elevated levels of the 90 kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) in SLE correlate with levels of IL-6 and autoantibodies to hsp90.;2001;Journal of autoimmunity;Ripley BJ;Levels of the 90 kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) are elevated in a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) due to enhanced transcription of the hsp90beta gene. In cultured cells, transcription of the hsp90beta gene is induced following exposure to IL-6 or IL-10 which are known to be elevated in SLE patients. Here we have measured the levels of hsp90 protein and of IL-6, IL-10 in SLE patients and normal controls. We demonstrate that the levels of hsp90 protein in individual patients correlate with the IL-6 level but not with the level of IL-10. Moreover, hsp90 protein levels in patients correlate with the presence of  IgG autoantibodies to hsp90. These results support a model in which elevated levels of IL-6 in SLE patients induce elevated levels of hsp90 protein which in turn results in the production of autoantibodies to this protein.;2001-2003
363;Pycnogenol efficacy in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus patients.;2001;Phytotherapy research : PTR;Stefanescu M;A pilot study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of Pycnogenol treatment in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Eleven SLE patients were treated with first line medication according to disease activity and in addition, six of  them received Pycnogenol and five a placebo. The SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI), serum anti-dsDNA antibodies, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils, spontaneous apoptosis and p56(lck) specific activity in peripheral blood lymphocytes were evaluated. Pycnogenol treatment determined a significant reduction of ROS production, apoptosis, p56(lck) specific activity and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In addition, the decrease of SLEDAI was significant in the Pycnogenol treated group compared with the placebo group (p =  0.018). The results obtained suggest that Pycnogenol could be useful for second line therapy to reduce the inflammatory feature of SLE.;2001-2003
364;The role of technetium-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion single-photon emission  computed tomography (SPECT) in the detection of cardiovascular involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus patients with non-specific chest complaints.;2001;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Sun SS;OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can affect multiple organs. Coronary artery disease has received increasing recognition as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SLE in recent years. The purpose of this study was to  evaluate the utility of technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed  tomography ((99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT) in the detection of cardiovascular involvement in SLE patients with non-specific clinical chest symptoms such as chest discomfort and/or dyspnoea and/or occasional palpitation. METHODS: Thirty-three SLE female patients (age range: 22-45 yr) with non-specific complaints such as chest discomfort and/or dyspnoea and/or occasional palpitation were investigated using a (99m)Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion SPECT scan at rest and after dipyridamole infusion in a stress study. The age- and sex-matched  healthy group (24 cases) and SLE patients without any cardiovascular symptoms/signs (28 cases) were also included as controls in this study. The results of the uptake pattern of (99m)Tc-sestamibi were classified into four types including normal, persistent perfusion defect, reversible perfusion defect  and reverse redistribution. RESULTS: Perfusion abnormalities were detected in 27  cases (seven patients had persistent perfusion defects, 15 patients had reversible perfusion defects, one patient had both persistent and reversible perfusion defects, two patients showed a reverse redistribution pattern and two patients had both reversible perfusion defects and a reverse redistribution pattern). The results of the SPECT in the healthy group were all normal. However, perfusion abnormalities were detected in 12 cases in the group of asymptomatic SLE patients. CONCLUSIONS: (99m)Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion SPECT is a useful non-invasive imaging modality to detect cardiovascular involvement in SLE  patients with non-specific clinical complaints of heart disease.;2001-2003
365;Systemic lupus erythematosus. Disease outcome in patients with a disease duration of at least 10 years: second evaluation.;2001;Lupus;Swaak AJ;Data related to the disease course of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) with special attention to the persistence of disease activity in the long term are scarce. At this moment reliable figures are only known about the survival rate as a measure of outcome. The aim of this multicenter study was to describe the outcome of SLE patients with a disease duration of greater than 10 y. Outcome parameters were two disease activity-scoring systems (SLEDAI and ECLAM), the end organ damage (SLICC/ACR damage index) and treatment. Our results  are derived from 187 SLE patients followed at 10 different centres in Europe over a period of 1 y. Serious clinical signs or exacerbations, defined by the occurrence or detoriation of already existing symptoms of renal and cerebral nervous systems were observed in 2-11% of the patients, seizures and psychosis in 3%, proteinuria in 11% and an increase in serum creatinine in 5% of the patients. No change took place in the overall damage index. Yet, the disease course in most patients was characterized by periods of tiredness (42-60%), arthritis (20-25%),  skin involvement such as malar rash (32-40%), migraine (15-20%), anaemia (15%) and leucopenia (17-19%). Summarizing these results it is shown that patients, still under care after such a long time of having this disease, do have a disease that is far from extinguished.;2001-2003
366;Comparison of lung perfusion scintigraphic findings in pulmonary thromboembolism  in systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE plus antiphospholipid syndrome, and primary  antiphospholipid syndrome.;2000;Nuclear medicine communications;Aung W;"In this study, we compared and reviewed the findings on lung perfusion scans performed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic lupus erythematosus with associated antiphospholipid syndrome (SLE + APS), and primary  antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS), to evaluate the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in restricted samples of the patient groups. Lung perfusion scintigraphy with 99Tc(m)-macroaggregated albumin was performed in 31 patients (SLE = 7; SLE + APS = 14; PAPS = 10). The seven patients with SLE alone and the 10 patients with  PAPS had normal perfusion lung scans. Six of the 14 SLE + APS patients showed a segmental uptake defect on multi-view perfusion scans. Thus, the SLE + APS patients were found to have a higher risk of pulmonary thromboembolism than the SLE alone and primary APS patients (P<0.05). The results of our study suggest that lung perfusion scintigraphy should be performed routinely in these patients, even in the absence of pulmonary clinical manifestations, to obtain baseline data for disease outcome and management.";1998-2000

368;Preservation of fertility and ovarian function and minimizing gonadotoxicity in young women with systemic lupus erythematosus treated by chemotherapy.;2000;Lupus;Blumenfeld Z;BACKGROUND: Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a common long-term consequence of  chemotherapy. Whereas the cytotoxic-induced damage is reversible in other tissues of rapidly dividing cells such as bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract and thymus, it appears to be progressive and irreversible in the ovary, where the number of germ cells is limited, fixed since the fetal life, and cannot be regenerated. The gonadal toxicity of cyclophosphamide is well known. In patients with lupus nephritis, premature ovarian failure (POF) was reported in half of all treated women after cyclophosphamide pulse therapy, affecting 100% of those older than 30 y, about 50% of the patients between the ages of 20-30y and only 13% of the patients younger than 20y of age. Following our preliminary encouraging experience in women with lymphoma, whereby the temporary induction of a prepubertal hormonal milieu, during chemotherapy, has significantly decreased the risk of POF, we have administered a monthly injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonistic analogue (GnRH-a) to eight young women in parallel to alkylating agent chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A monthly intramuscular depot injection of 3.75 mg D-TRP6-GnRH-a (Decapeptyl C.R.) was administered after informed consent to eight women with autoimmune, severe connective tissue diseases (seven SLE patients and one woman with nephrotic syndrome) in parallel to chemotherapy, for up to six months. The institutional committee for human experimentation approved the protocol. The concentrations of FSH, LH, progesterone, and 17-beta-estradiol (E2) were measured before, during and after the GnRH-a/chemotherapy treatment. A transvaginal (or transabdominal) sonography  (TVS) was performed on each patient before and after treatment. These eight treated patients (study group) were compared to a group of nine women similarly treated by cyclophosphamide pulses (CPT) or chlorambucil for SLE/connective tissue disease but were not referred for the GnRH-a adjuvant treatment. RESULTS:  Whereas none of the eight women receiving GnRH-a in parallel to alkylating agent  chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide (7) or chlorambucil (1)) suffered POF and hypergonadotropic amenorrhea, five of the nine ( > 50%) patients treated by alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide (8) or chlorambucil (1)) experienced POF. Whereas two of these five women were 35 y old, the other three were < or = 23 y old at the time of the chemotherapeutic insult. CONCLUSIONS: Our present results, extrapolating this encouraging experience from hematological malignant diseases to severe connective tissue diseases, such as SLE associated nephropathy or others, suggests that the beneficial effect of GnRH-a co-treatment may be exploited towards preservation of future fertility and ovarian function in every  young woman of reproductive age, exposed to alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil.;1998-2000
369;Immunoadsorption onto protein A induces remission in severe systemic lupus erythematosus.;2000;Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European;Braun N;BACKGROUND: Reduction of pathological autoantibodies and circulating immune complexes can be useful in the treatment of autoimmune disease. Plasmapheresis has been shown to reduce autoantibody levels in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but its effect on patients' outcome was not better compared with conventional immunosuppression in the past. AIM OF THE STUDY: Immunoadsorption as a selective extracorporeal immunoglobulin elimination technique was evaluated as  rescue therapy in patients suffering from SLE. METHODS: Eight patients with severe, therapy-resistant SLE underwent immunoadsorption onto protein A sepharose without concomitant immunosuppressants. RESULTS: Remission of the disease was achieved in seven patients. Therapy had to be stopped in one patient because of side-effects. The best results were obtained when immunoadsorption was carried out daily, without supplementary intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Oral cyclophosphamide for 3-6 months during follow-up was used to suppress relapse. Autoantibodies and circulating immune complexes were effectively eliminated regardless of their IgG subclass. CONCLUSION: Immunoadsorption onto protein A might be used as an extracorporeal treatment option in SLE when other therapies are ineffective.;1998-2000
370;Cyclosporine-A plus steroids versus steroids alone in the 12-month treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.;2000;International journal of clinical & laboratory research;Dammacco F;The positive results obtained with cyclosporine-A both in an experimental model and in selected patients with advanced systemic lupus erythematosus support the hypothesis that the drug could be used as a steroid sparer in the earliest stages of active disease. To determine the 12-month clinical efficacy (disease control and steroid sparing), safety, and tolerability of low-dose cyclosporine-A plus steroids versus steroids alone, we designed a multicenter, open, prospective, randomized, pilot study, controlled for parallel groups. The patients were then followed up to month 24. A total of 18 consenting patients with recently diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus of moderate severity indicated for the use of steroids in acute boluses and subsequently per os were enrolled at two university hospital medical centers. The protocol was based on three 1-g boluses  of 6-methylprednisolone followed by cyclosporine-A (<5 mg/kg per day) plus prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg per day per os, reduced by 5 mg/day every 2 weeks following clinical remission, versus the same doses of oral prednisone alone. The efficacy evaluation was based on a four-point scale (from absent/none to severe)  for signs and symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus and immunoserological parameters. The disease activity index and cumulative prednisone dose per patient were analyzed. Any adverse events were reported. All patients showed a reduction  in disease activity index within the 1st month. The results were significantly better in the group with cyclosporine-A plus prednisone throughout month 12 (baseline and 12-month disease activity indexes: 21.3+/-8.6 and 5.0+/-2.5 versus  20.4+/-7.1 and 8.8+/-6.0 in the prednisone group, P<0.05). The 12-month cumulative mean dose of prednisone was significantly lower in the group with both cyclosporine-A plus prednisone (179.4+/-40.1 versus 231.8+/-97.1 mg/kg, P<0.005). No unusual adverse events related to the study drugs have been reported. In particular, renal function and blood pressure monitoring revealed no significant  changes from mean baseline values in either group. No disease flares were reported in the group treated with cyclosporine-A plus prednisone during the 12-  to 24-month period. Thus cyclosporine-A represents a useful corticosteroid sparer in the maintenance of clinical remission in patients with an early-stage, active  systemic lupus erythematosus.;1998-2000
371;Illness intrusiveness explains race-related quality-of-life differences among women with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2000;Lupus;Devins GM;Our objective was to investigate whether quality of life in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) differs across ethnoracial groups and to identify factors that may explain race-related differences. Self-administered questionnaire data from 335 White, 40 Black, and 30 Asian women with SLE were obtained from a multi-center database. Measures assessed illness intrusiveness, psychological well-being, depressive symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and learned helplessness.  Extent of SLE disease activity was indexed by self-reported functional-system involvement. Educational attainment was indicated by number of years in school. Principal-components analysis reduced the four psychosocial measures to a single  factor score. This represented psychosocial well-being In path analysis. Psychosocial well-being differed significantly across the three groups, with Whites reporting the highest, and Blacks the lowest, levels. Path analysis indicated that illness intrusiveness accounted for this race-related difference.  Although disease activity was significantly associated with psychosocial well-being, it did not differ across ethnoracial groups. Illness intrusiveness and educational attainment emerged as independent mediators of the race-related difference in psychosocial well-being. We conclude that race-related quality-of-life differences exist among women with SLE and are mediated independently by illness intrusiveness and educational attainment.;1998-2000

European Concerted Action on the Immunogenetics of SLE.;2000;The Journal of rheumatology;Galeazzi M;"OBJECTIVE: To assay anti-ganglioside antibodies (aGM1) in sera of a large cohort  of European patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) to define the prevalence of these autoantibodies in SLE; to evaluate the association of aGM1 with clinical manifestations and other autoantibodies found in SLE; and to search for aGM1 association with HLA class II alleles. METHODS: Four hundred forty-eight patients with SLE were consecutively enrolled in 8 centers from 6 European countries. All sera were tested for antinuclear antibodies by immunofluorescence  on HEp-2 cells as substrate, anti-dsDNA, aGM1, aCL, abeta2-glycoprotein I (abeta2-GPI) antibodies by ELISA, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) by immunofluorescence and by ELISA. Genomic typing for HLA class II loci was performed by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide probe method. Clinical assessment was done at the time of enrolment. RESULTS: We  found 41.9% of patients with clinical signs of neuropsychiatric involvement; 15.5% of patients were positive for aGM1, 8% of the IgG isotype and 8.6% of the IgM isotype; aGM1-IgG were associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations (NPM)  (RR = 3.7), with migraine (RR = 2.4), with OBS (RR = 7.3), and with peripheral neuropathy (RR = 8.5). aGM1-IgM were associated with NPM (RR = 4) and with depression (RR = 3.4). Furthermore, the genetic study showed that aGM1-IgG were associated with HLA-DQB1*0404 (RR = 7.2) while aGM1-IgM were associated with HLA-DQB1*0605 (RR = 33.3). No associations were found between aGM1 and anti-dsDNA, aCL, abeta2GP1, or ANCA. CONCLUSION: Our results show aGM1 can be found in patients with SLE. aGM1 may play a pathogenetic role for some NPM in this condition.";1998-2000
373;HLA class II alleles associations of anticardiolipin and anti-beta2GPI antibodies in a large series of European patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;2000;Lupus;Galeazzi M;The objective of this study was to determine the HLA class II associations of the anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2GPI (abeta2GPI) antibodies in a large series  of European patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A cohort of 577 European SLE patients was enrolled. aCL and abeta2GPI were measured by ELISA methods. Molecular typing of HLA-DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, DQA1 and DQB1 loci was performed by the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) method. aCL of IgG, IgM and IgA isotypes were detected in 22.8%, 14% and 13.9% of patients, respectively. IgG and IgM abeta2GPI were detected in 20% of patients. aCL showed positive association with HLA DRB1*04, DRB1*0402, DRB1*0403, DRB1*07, DRB3*0301, DQA1*0201, DQA1*0301, DQB1*0302, and negative association with DQA1*0501, DRB3*0202. abeta2GPI showed positive association with DRB1*0402, DRB1*0403, DQB1*0302. DRB1*0402 carried the highest relative risk for the presence of both aCL (RR=8. 1) and abeta2GPI (RR=4.6). Our  results confirm the already described associations of aCL with HLA DR4 and DR7, but also demonstrate that, among the alleles at the DRB1*04 locus, the *0402 was  most represented both in aCL and in abeta2GPI positive patients. In addition, HLA class II associations of abeta2GPI are for the first time extensively examined in a large cohort of European SLE patients.;1998-2000
374;Altered function of the hypothalamic stress axes in patients with moderately active systemic lupus erythematosus. I. The hypothalamus-autonomic nervous system axis.;2000;The Journal of rheumatology;Gluck T;OBJECTIVE: To determine the human corticotropin releasing hormone (hCRH) induced  stress response of the hypothalamus-autonomic nervous system axis (HANS) in patients with moderately active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Cardiovascular and pupillary function variables were measured by standardized computer procedures before and during an hCRH test (6 time points). The results of 12 patients with SLE were compared to 24 healthy subjects with (HS+P, n = 12)  and without (HS, n = 12) prior administration of prednisolone 3 days before the test. RESULTS: At baseline, diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher in  SLE than in HS or HS+P (p<0.001). During the hCRH test, patients with SLE had increased heart rates and systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses compared to HS+P and HS (p<0.001 for all comparisons). Moreover, heart rate variation was decreased at rest, during the lying-to-standing procedure, and during the 2 applied respiratory tests (p<0.01 vs. HS). Compared to HS+P and HS,  latency time of the pupillary light reflex was prolonged and maximal pupillary area was increased, revealing sympathetic hyperreactivity. CONCLUSION: This study found an altered autonomic nervous system response at baseline, which was more pronounced during the hCRH stress test in patients with moderately active SLE compared to healthy subjects. Baseline and stress responses are characterized by  a sympathetic overstimulation. Such a hypersympathetic reaction may lead to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients with moderately active SLE, which needs to be investigated in longitudinal studies.;1998-2000
375;Intermittent intravenous cyclophosphamide arrests progression of the renal chronicity index in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus.;2000;The Journal of pediatrics;Lehman TJ;OBJECTIVE: To assess prospectively the safety and efficacy of a 36-month course of systematic bolus intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy (IVCY) for children with lupus nephritis. STUDY DESIGN: Sixteen children with lupus nephritis were treated with IVCY for 36 months. Renal biopsies performed before and after treatment were scored for activity and chronicity. SLEDAI scores, laboratory measures, and prednisone dosage were recorded at the time of each treatment. RESULTS: After 36  months of IVCY therapy, the renal biopsy activity index decreased from 9 +/- 4 to 1 +/- 1 (P <.001) without a change in chronicity. The mean creatinine clearance increased from 90 +/- 23 to 107 +/- 23 mL/min/1.73 mol/L(2) (P <.01), and the mean 24-hour urine protein excretion decreased from 2.0 +/- 2.4 g/24 h to 0.5 +/- 0.7 g/24 h (P <.05). The mean SLEDAI score decreased from 19 +/- 5.2 to 2.9 +/- 3.1 (P <.001). The mean prednisone dosage decreased from 35.5 +/- 20 mg/d to 14.0 +/- 3 mg/d (P <.001). No significant complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-six months of systematic IVCY therapy led to decreased renal biopsy activity without progression of chronicity, with excellent disease control and a  greater than 50% reduction in mean corticosteroid dose.;1998-2000
376;Clinical and biologic effects of anti-interleukin-10 monoclonal antibody administration in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2000;Arthritis and rheumatism;Llorente L;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of administering an anti-interleukin-10 (anti-IL-10) monoclonal antibody (mAb) to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with active and steroid-dependent disease. In addition, we sought to assess the effects of in vivo IL-10 neutralization on biologic markers of SLE. METHODS: Treatment consisted of 20 mg/day intravenous administration of an anti-IL-10 murine mAb (B-N10) for 21 consecutive days, with  a followup period of 6 months. Six patients were studied. RESULTS: Treatment was  safe and well tolerated. All patients developed antibodies against B-N10. Cutaneous lesions and joint symptoms improved in all patients beginning during B-N10 administration and continuing to month 6. The SLE Disease Activity Index decreased from a mean +/- SEM of 8.83+/-0.91 on day 1 to 3.67+/-0.67 on day 21 (P = 0.001), 1.50+/-0.84 at month 2, and 1.33+/-0.80 at month 6 (P<0.001). At the end of followup, the disease was clinically inactive in 5 of the 6 patients. Prednisone administration was decreased from a mean +/- SEM of 27.9+/-5.7 mg/day  on day 1 to 9.6+/-2.0 mg/day at month 6 (P<0.005). Activity of immune and endothelial cells rapidly decreased, as assessed by the early evolution of several biologic markers. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of IL-10 antagonist administration to humans. The study shows the involvement of IL-10 in  the pathogenesis of SLE, and indicates that the use of IL-10 antagonists may be beneficial in the management of refractory SLE.;1998-2000

These columns can adsorb pathogenic anti-DNA  subgroups of high avidity and/or cationic antibodies, anticardiolipin, anti-CLbeta2GPI, and anaphylatoxins. An open clinical study on 19 SLE cases (the  mean number of apheresis sessions totaled 3.7 times; the mean dose of prednisolone, 38 mg/day) revealed that the mean SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score significantly decreased from the pretreatment level of 10.2 to 4.5 after treatment. Several case reports have indicated that this modality might also be useful for treating patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. Compartment  model analyses showed the one-compartment model to be the most suitable for the kinetics of anti-DNA during and following the apheresis procedure. The indications for immunoadsorption in the treatment of SLE remain controversial. A  steroid-sparing effect might be one of them, but further controlled studies are necessary to verify this hypothesis.";1998-2000
379;A prospective study of factors affecting quality of life in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2000;The Journal of rheumatology;Thumboo J;OBJECTIVE: To prospectively identify factors influencing quality of life (QOL) over 6 months in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Ninety ethnically diverse patients with SLE completed questionnaires administered 6 months apart assessing QOL (using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36) and demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and behavioral factors. Disease activity, damage, and treatment were recorded at both evaluations. Multiple linear regression (adjusting for baseline health status) was used to identify factors influencing mental and physical health. RESULTS: Improved physical health after 6 months was associated with reductions in learned helplessness (p = 0.034), improved mental health (p<0.001), longer disease duration (p = 0.009), and better physical health at baseline (p = 0.027). Improved mental health after  6 months was associated with better family support (p = 0.002), improvements in physical health (p<0.001), disease activity, and prednisolone dose (interaction term p = 0.019), less disease related damage (p<0.001), non-use of cytotoxic drugs (p = 0.02), and older age at diagnosis (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Potentially modifiable psychosocial, disease, and therapy related factors influence QOL in patients with SLE.;1998-2000
380;Accuracy of medical record scoring of the SLICC/ACR damage index for systemic lupus erythematosus.;2000;Lupus;Thumboo J;OBJECTIVE: To study the accuracy of medical record scoring of the SLICC/ACR Damage Index (DI) for SLE. METHODS: Medical record DI (MDI) scoring of 60 SLE patients by one physician was compared with prospective direct DI (DDI) scoring a median of 2 y earlier. Agreement between DDI and MDI total and organ system scores was compared using Cohen's kappa, the degree of misclassification by MDI and the significance of differences between DDI and MDI scores. RESULTS: The mean duration of SLE at DDI scoring was 5.2 y. The median/mean (SD) DDI and MDI total  scores were 0/0.78 (1.38) and 0/0. 85 (1.44). Damage was present on DDI and MDI scoring in 36.7% (22/60) and 38.3% (23/60) of patients. Qualitative MDI and DDI total scores (damage present/absent) showed good agreement (kappa=0.61, 95% CI=0.40-0.82, 18.3% misclassification). Quantitative MDI and DDI total scores (degree of damage) showed moderate agreement (kappa=0. 47, 95% CI=0.28-0.66, 36.7% misclassification). 9 of 12 MDI organ system scores misclassified <10% of subjects. There was no statistically significant difference between DDI and MDI total or organ system scores. CONCLUSION: MDI total scoring is a good qualitative and moderate quantitative reflection of SLE related damage. MDI organ system scores are more accurate than MDI total scores.;1998-2000
381;The benefit of combining hydroxychloroquine with quinacrine in the treatment of SLE patients.;2000;Lupus;Toubi E;"BACKGROUND: Although the benefit of antimalarials in the treatment of cutaneous LE is well established, the effect of combined hydroxychloroquine and quinacrine  treatment in systemic lupus erythematosus with major organ involvement remains underappreciated. PATIENTS: Six active SLE patients (SLEDAI score > 5 points), with a mean duration of illness 9.1 yr (range 2-17 yr) were started on quinacrine (100 mg/d) following failure to achieve clinical remission on a therapeutic regimen which included a maintenance dose of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d) together with prednisone (either 10-20 mg/d or higher daily doses of this agent for short periods) and azathioprine (150 mg/d) or methotrexate (7.5 mg/week). OUTCOME: In 5/6 of the patients the addition of quinacrine to the previous treatment resulted in complete remission (SLEDAI 0-2 points), which persisted over the follow-up period [mean +/- 2.2 yr (range 0.5-3.5)]. During this period hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine were reduced to 200 mg/d and 100 mg/d respectively, whereas prednisone was modified as follows: in 2 patients daily administration was discontinued; in one the dose was reduced to 2.5 mg/d (from that of > or = 20 mg/d); in 2 others the previous need for an intermittent course was avoided. However, in one out of the six patients the addition for 3 months of quinacrine to the therapeutic protocol did not result in clinical improvement and was therefore discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: The promising results of this preliminary investigation encourages the combined use of the two antimalarial drugs in appropriate candidates. This modality may induce remission, seems to be  safe and possesses a steroid sparing effect.";1998-2000
382;Treatment of severe systemic lupus erythematosus with high-dose chemotherapy and  haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation: a phase I study.;2000;Lancet;Traynor AE;BACKGROUND: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who experience persistent multiorgan dysfunction, despite standard doses of intravenous cyclophosphamide, represent a subset of patients at high risk of early death. We  investigated the safety and efficacy of immune suppression and autologous haemopoietic stem-cell infusion to treat such patients. METHODS: From 1996, we selected patients with persistent SLE despite use of cyclophosphamide. Patients underwent dose-intense immune suppression and autologous haemopoietic stem-cell (CD34) infusion. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were analysed by flow cytometry, ELISA, and T-cell-receptor spectratyping before and after transplantation. We mobilised autologous haemopoietic stem cells with 2.0 g/m2 cyclophosphamide and 10 microg/kg granulocyte colony stimulating factor daily, enriched with CD34-positive selection, and reinfused after immunosuppression with 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide, 1 g methylprednisolone, and 90 mg/kg equine antithymocyte globulin. RESULTS: Nine patients underwent stem-cell mobilisation but two were excluded before transplantation because of infection. The remaining seven received high-dose chemotherapy and stem-cell infusion. Median time to an absolute neutrophil count higher than 0.5x10(9)/L and nontransfused platelet count higher than 20x10(9)/L was 9 days (range 8-11) and 11 days (10-13), respectively. At a median follow-up of 25 months (12-40), all patients were free  from signs of active lupus. Renal, cardiac, pulmonary, and serological markers, and T cell phenotype and repertoire had normalised. INTERPRETATION: Patients remained free from active lupus and improved continuously after transplantation,  with no immunosuppressive medication or small residual doses of prednisone. T-cell repertoire diversity and responsiveness was restored. Durability of remission remains to be established.;1998-2000
383;Mood states and disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus treated with bromocriptine.;2000;Lupus;Walker SE;We tested mood states in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treated with the prolactin-lowering drug, bromocriptine. Bromocriptine was given to seven patients in an open-label study to test its effects on active SLE. Two independent measures of SLE activity, the SLE Activity Measure (SLAM) and the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), were scored and the Symptom Questionnaire (SQ) mood survey was administered at entry and at 6 monthly follow-up visits. The SLAM and SLEDAI scores improved significantly during treatment. Two of the four mood scales in the SQ (Anxiety Scale and Anger-Hostility Scale) showed significant improvement compared to the entry value at least once during treatment. Significant improvement was also observed in the Total Distress Score, which is the sum of the four scales and is a more sensitive measure of distress than the score of an individual scale. Depression, anxiety, somatic complaints, and total  distress correlated positively with SLAM and/or SLEDAI scores. The Anxiety Scale  and the Total Distress Score improved with treatment and did correlate positively with SLE activity. In contrast, the Anger-Hostility Scale improved with treatment but did not correlate with SLE activity.;1998-2000
384;Outcome of total hip replacement for avascular necrosis in systemic lupus erythematosus.;2000;The Journal of rheumatology;Zangger P;"OBJECTIVE: To describe the short and medium term results of total hip arthroplasty (THA) for avascular necrosis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Nineteen patients with SLE and avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVNFH), who underwent 26 THA were retrospectively reviewed with a minimum followup of 2 years. To determine whether these patients had results similar to those of patients with other conditions, we formed a control group of 19 patients who had 29 THA. They were matched for age, sex, and followup to the patients with SLE. Controls had THA for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (n = 7), osteoarthritis (5), adult onset rheumatoid arthritis (8), developmental dysplasia of the hip (4), and other diagnoses (5). Outcome measures included a 10 point visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, the Harris hip score, and the SF-36 self-administered health outcome questionnaire. We used the methods of Delee, Harris, and Engh for radiological assessment. RESULTS: Mean age at surgery was 46 years (range 21-71 years) and average followup was 4 years, 7 months (range 1 yr  9 mo to 9 yrs 6 mo), similar in both groups. Technical problems, mostly consisting of small, nonpropagating cracks of the calcar in uncemented stems, were encountered in 4 SLE hips and 1 control hip. Six complications were noted in the SLE group, including 2 early, nonrecurrent dislocations, 1 patient with thigh pain for 1 year, 1 pericarditis, 1 sick-sinus syndrome, and 1 urinary tract infection. There was one case of urinary tract infection in the control group. One SLE patient developed a low grade prosthetic infection and underwent successful revision 2 years after primary surgery. Clinical outcome measures had  similar scores in the 2 groups: average VAS pain score = 2.00 in SLE hips (maximum 10) and 1.97 in control hips; mean Harris hip score = 86.7 in SLE patients (maximum 100) and 81.9 in controls; average SF-36 score = 63.4 in SLE patients (maximum 100) and 60.5 in controls. There was no radiological evidence of implant loosening in controls; there was 1 asymptomatic cup migration in the SLE group. CONCLUSION: In the short and medium term, patients with SLE and AVN had good results after THA. Results were similar in patients who had hip replacement for other diagnoses. Less favorable clinical outcomes of hip replacement have been reported in young patients who have AVN of other etiology (e.g., alcoholic, post-traumatic), but this was not the case in our young patients who had AVN and SLE. Thus, AVNFH and SLE should not constitute a contraindication to hip replacement.";1998-2000
385;Altered function of the hypothalamic stress axes in patients with moderately active systemic lupus erythematosus. II. Dissociation between androstenedione, cortisol, or dehydroepiandrosterone and interleukin 6 or tumor necrosis factor.;2000;The Journal of rheumatology;Zietz B;OBJECTIVE: To investigate adrenocorticotropin, androstenedione (ASD), cortisol, or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) before and during a corticotropin releasing hormone (hCRH) test in patients with moderately active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) undergoing low dose longterm glucocorticoid therapy, and to examine these hormones in relation to interleukin 6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). METHODS: Serum levels of hormones and cytokines were measured before and during an hCRH test. The results of 12 patients with SLE were compared to 12 healthy subjects (HS) and 12 healthy subjects given prior short term prednisolone (HS+P). RESULTS: Baseline and stimulated serum ASD, cortisol, and DHEAS were lower in patients with SLE vs. HS (p<0.005), but baseline and stimulated plasma adrenocorticotropin was normal in SLE. In SLE, but not in HS+P  or HS, baseline and stimulated DHEAS was low in relation to cortisol or ASD (i.e., shift from DHEAS to cortisol or ASD). In patients with SLE, baseline and stimulated serum levels of adrenal hormones were lower in relation to IL-6 or TNF compared to HS or HS+P (p< 0.001). In contrast, in SLE patients, the baseline and stimulated pituitary hormone adrenocorticotropin was normal in relation to these  cytokines. CONCLUSION: We found marked adrenal insufficiency and a shift in steroidogenesis to cortisol in patients with SLE, but a completely normal pituitary function (in absolute values and in relation to IL-6 or TNF). This may  depend in part on prior longterm glucocorticoid therapy and changes of steroidogenesis due to cytokines. The situation in patients with SLE was not mimicked by high dose short term prednisolone in healthy subjects. Further longitudinal studies in untreated patients are needed to investigate the endocrine-immune interplay and its consequences during the course of SLE.;1998-2000
386;Systemic lupus erythematosus in three ethnic groups. VI: Factors associated with  fatigue within 5 years of criteria diagnosis. LUMINA Study Group. LUpus in MInority populations: NAture vs Nurture.;2000;Lupus;Zonana-Nacach A;"OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency, degree and associated features of fatigue  among Hispanic (H), African American (AA) and Caucasian (C) patients with recent  onset (< or = 5 yr) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) at their baseline evaluation. METHODS: H (n = 69), AA (n = 83) and C (n = 71) patients from the LUMINA (LUpus in MInority populations: NAture vs Nurture) cohort were studied. Fatigue [Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)] was defined as present if FSS score > or = 3.0. Variables from functional, clinical, sociodemographic, health behaviors, behavioral and psychological and immunogenetics domains were ascertained at study entry. Associations were examined using regression models. RESULTS: Eighty-six percent (85.7%) of patients reported having fatigue (82.6% H; 85.5% AA; 88.7% C); median FSS score, 5.3. Factors from the psychological and clinical domains were primarily associated with FSS; immunogenetic (HLA Class II phenotypes) features were not. Increased fatigue was strongly associated with decreasing function, both physical and mental. Variables associated with significantly greater degree  of fatigue at baseline in the multivariable stepwise model in order of decreasing additional partial R2 explained included: abnormal illness-related behaviors, older age, higher self-reported pain, greater degree of helplessness, greater disease activity, Caucasian race, and lacking health insurance (model R2 = 37%).  CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue is one of the most prevalent clinical manifestations of SLE  across all ethnic groups. The perception of fatigue severity in SLE may be multifactorial in origin, including psychosocial factors and disease activity. If these prove causal, knowledge of their contribution may suggest therapeutic and/or behavioral interventions, which could ameliorate this pervasive and often  incapacitating symptom of SLE.";1998-2000
387;Genetic analysis of the contribution of IL10 to systemic lupus erythematosus.;1999;The Journal of rheumatology;Alarcon-Riquelme ME;OBJECTIVE: To study the contribution of the IL10 gene to the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Analysis by fluorescent-semiautomated genotyping of a dinucleotide repeat located in the promoter region of the IL10 locus (microsatellite G). RESULTS: No significant difference was found in the frequencies of the microsatellite alleles of 330 Mexican patients with SLE compared to 368 controls from the same population. Two-point linkage analyses were carried out using 13 Mexican, 13 Swedish, and 8 Icelandic families with 2 or more cases with SLE. No linkage was revealed between IL10 and SLE, using a variety of parameter settings. CONCLUSION: Our results do not support that the IL10 gene contributes to the susceptibility to SLE in the populations we studied.;1998-2000
388;The utility of the lupus band test on sun-protected non-lesional skin for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.;1999;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Cardinali C;"OBJECTIVE: The sensitivity and specificity of the lupus band test was evaluated,  using three different criteria, on sun-protected non-lesional skin for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of the lupus band test was compared with those of other laboratory tests used in the diagnosis of SLE. METHODS: Sun-protected non-lesional skin biopsies from 65 patients (F 50; M 15; mean age 41 yrs.) with specific cutaneous  manifestations of lupus erythematosus (LE) and from 18 patients with other dermatologic diseases (F 11, M 7; mean age 40 yrs.) were tested using the direct  immunofluorescent technique. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the lupus band test was 10.5% and 97.8% respectively using the strict criterion of the presence of two different immunoreactants. The sensitivity and specificity were 52.6% and 69.5% respectively based on the presence of two different immunoreactants and were 78.9% and 47.8% based on the presence of only one immunoreactant. The highest sensitivity was found for ANA (100%). The specificity of all the laboratory abnormalities was particularly high, varying from 82.8% to  100%, except for ANA antibodies which showed a specificity of 65.2%. CONCLUSIONS: A positive lupus band test on sun-protected non-lesional skin (even if showing the presence of only one immunoreactant at the dermo-epidermal junction) represents a useful and specific criterion for identifying patients with LE. However, this test is not useful in distinguishing between cutaneous lupus patients with systemic involvement and those without systemic involvement.";1998-2000
389;Double blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial of methotrexate in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1999;The Journal of rheumatology;Carneiro JR;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the capacity of methotrexate (MTX) to control mild activity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and to evaluate the capacity of MTX to reduce steroid requirement, as well as to evaluate the side effects of MTX in patients with SLE. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled, double blind trial. Forty-one patients with SLE began and 37 completed the 6 months of study. The mean disease duration was 82.5 months. Twenty patients received MTX 15-20 mg/week (MTX group) and 21 received placebo (PL group). The dose of prednisone was maintained, increased, or reduced after the first month, according to monthly clinical and laboratory evaluation. Dose of prednisone, SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores, the score by visual analog scale (VAS) for articular pain, and laboratory results were recorded monthly. Both groups were homogeneous and comparable for clinical manifestations and laboratory results. RESULTS: Two placebo patients dropped out due to severe flare of disease requiring hospitalization, and 2 patients taking MTX dropped out due to side effects (one with pulmonary tuberculosis, one with urticaria and severe dyspepsia). Thirty-seven patients (18 MTX and 19 PL) completed the study. At the  end of the study 16 PL patients and one MTX patient presented articular complaints (p < 0.001). VAS scores for pain were significantly higher in the PL group than in the MTX group after the first month of study. Sixteen PL patients and 3 MTX patients presented cutaneous lesions after 6 months of treatment (p < 0.001). At the end of the study 4 MTX patients and 11 PL patients presented hypocomplementemia (p < 0.001). Mean SLEDAI scores in PL patients were significantly higher than in MTX patients at Months 3, 4, 5, and 6. It was possible to decrease the prednisone dose for 13 MTX patients during the study but for only one PL patient (p < 0.001). Fourteen MTX patients (70%) presented side effects, mainly dyspepsia and increase in hepatic enzyme serum levels, and 3 PL patients (14%) presented dyspepsia. CONCLUSION: MTX 15 to 20 mg/week for 6 months was effective in controlling cutaneous and articular activity of SLE and permitted prednisone dose reduction. At these doses MTX presented frequent but mild side effects that did not result in drug discontinuation in the majority of  patients.;1998-2000
390;Morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus during a 5-year period. A multicenter prospective study of 1,000 patients. European Working Party on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.;1999;Medicine;Cervera R;"In the present study we assessed the frequency and characteristics of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in SLE during a 5-year period and analyzed the  prognostic significance for morbidity and mortality of the main immunologic parameters used in clinical practice. We started in 1990 a multicenter study of 1,000 patients from 7 European countries. All had medical histories documented and underwent medical interview and routine general physical examination when entered in the study, and all were followed prospectively by the same physicians  during the ensuing 5 years (1990-1995). Four hundred thirteen patients (41.3%) presented 1 or more episodes of arthritis, 264 (26.4%) had malar rash, 222 (22.2%) active nephropathy, 139 (13.9%) fever, 136 (13.6%) neurologic involvement, 132 (13.2%) Raynaud phenomenon, 129 (12.9%) serositis (pleuritis and/or pericarditis), 95 (9.5%) thrombocytopenia, and 72 (7.2%) thrombosis. Two hundred seventy patients (27%) presented infections, 113 (11.3%) hypertension, 75 (7.5%) osteoporosis, and 59 (5.9%) cytopenia due to immunosuppressive agents. Sixteen patients (1.6%) developed malignancies, with the most frequent primary localizations the uterus and the breast. Several immunologic parameters (anti-dsDNA or antiphospholipid antibodies) were found to have a predictive value for the development of SLE manifestations during the period of the study. Forty-five patients (4.5%) died; the most frequent causes of death were divided similarly among active SLE (28.9%), infections (28.9%), and thromboses (26.7%). A survival probability of 95% at 5 years was found. A lower survival probability (92%) was detected in those patients who presented at the beginning of the study  with nephropathy.";1998-2000
391;The effects of low-intensity warfarin on coagulation activation in patients with  antiphospholipid antibodies and systemic lupus erythematosus.;1999;Thrombosis and haemostasis;Douketis JD;The optimal intensity of oral anticoagulant therapy for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) and systemic  lupus erythematosus is controversial. Retrospective studies have suggested that patients with APLA are resistant to oral anticoagulant therapy, with a targeted International Normalization Ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0, and that a higher intensity of anticoagulation (INR: 2.6 to 4.5) is required to prevent recurrent thromboembolism. To investigate if patients with APLA are resistant to the anticoagulant effect of low intensities of warfarin therapy, we performed a randomized trial in which 21 patients with APLA and systemic lupus erythematosus  were allocated to receive one of three intensities of warfarin (INR: 1.1 to 1.4,  1.5 to 1.9 or 2.0 to 2.5) or placebo for four months. The main outcome was the effect of each intensity of warfarin therapy on prothrombin fragment 1+2 level (F1+2), that was used as a marker of coagulation activation. When F1+2 levels in  patients allocated to the three warfarin intensities were compared to F1+2 levels in the placebo group, there was a statistically significant decrease (p<0.05) in  the patient group receiving warfarin with a targeted INR of 2.0 to 2.5 at two, three and four months, and in the patient group with a targeted of INR 1.5 to 1.9 at three months. We conclude that in patients with APLA and systemic lupus erythematosus, warfarin therapy, with a targeted INR of 2.0 to 2.5, is effective  in suppressing coagulation activation, and therefore, might be effective in preventing thromboembolism.;1998-2000

394;Determinants of enhanced thromboxane biosynthesis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1999;Arthritis and rheumatism;Ferro D;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the rate of thromboxane biosynthesis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), exploring the interplay between antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and 2 markers of endothelial perturbation: thrombin generation and platelet activation. METHODS: A comparison of 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (TXB2) excretion, which is a marker of in vivo platelet  activation, aPL, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which are 2 circulating markers of endothelial perturbation, and plasma levels of the prothrombin fragment F1+2, which is a marker of thrombin generation, was performed in 40 SLE patients and 40 healthy subjects. Thromboxane metabolite excretion was also measured in 8 SLE patients before and after treatment with low-dose aspirin. RESULTS: SLE patients had significantly higher 11-dehydro-TXB2 excretion, plasma F1+2, vWF, and tPA levels than controls. A statistically significant correlation was found between plasma levels of vWF and  tPA and excretion of thromboxane metabolite. Moreover, significantly higher 11-dehydro-TXB2 was found in patients with aPL positivity and endothelial perturbation. Low-dose aspirin suppressed 11-dehydro-TXB2 by 80%, suggesting a predominant platelet source of enhanced thromboxane biosynthesis. After a median  followup of 48 months, all SLE patients who experienced major cardiovascular events had thromboxane metabolite excretion, aPL positivity, and signs of endothelial perturbation. CONCLUSION: We have characterized a sensitive marker of platelet activation, which is abnormal in SLE patients who were positive for aPL  and endothelial perturbation. This analytical approach may help identify those patients at increased risk of thrombosis as potential candidates for antiplatelet therapy.;1998-2000
395;Cyclophosphamide pulse therapy in optic neuritis due to systemic lupus erythematosus: an open trial.;1999;The American journal of medicine;Galindo-Rodriguez G;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy in patients with optic neuritis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with optic neuritis due to  SLE whose condition was refractory to corticosteroids and oral immunosuppressants were treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide (0.5 to 1.0 g/m2) monthly for 6 months. RESULTS: All patients had bilateral eye involvement. One eye was legally  blind, and 13 eyes could see only hand movements or count fingers. Six patients had evidence of the secondary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Complete recovery in visual acuity occurred in 10 eyes (50%), and a partial response occurred in six eyes (30%); four eyes (20%) had no response. Complete response in the field tests occurred in eight eyes (40%), with a partial response in nine eyes (45%); no improvement occurred in three eyes (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy seems to be an effective treatment for optic neuritis refractory to corticosteroids, oral immunosuppressants, or both. A randomized controlled trial will be necessary to confirm our results.";1998-2000
396;Mycophenolate mofetil for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus: an open  pilot trial.;1999;Lupus;Gaubitz M;OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who were inadequately controlled with corticosteroids, antimalarials, and other immunosuppressive agents. METHODS: Ten patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were treated with 1500-2000  mg mycophenolae mofetil (MMF) daily for a median observation time of 11. 2+/-2.4  (8-16) months in an open clinical trial. The effectiveness and safety of treatment were analyzed using an established disease activity score, clinical status, and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: All patients improved under treatment with no or only minor side effects. The disease activity score (SLAM) decreased statistically significantly from a median of 15.6+/-5.5 to 9.9+/-4.1 after three  months (P<0.01) and to 8.0+/-3.3 after six months (P<0.01). Hematologic parameters did not change significantly whereas a reduction of inflammatory markers was observed. Four patients with SLE-nephritis already treated with cyclophosphamide pulse therapy continuously showed a slight improvement of renal  function. Prednisolone dosages could be reduced significantly from a median level of 10.0+/-5.1 mg/d before treatment to 4.6+/-3.5 mg/d after six months (P<0.01).  CONCLUSION: Mycophenolate mofetil is a promising option in immunosuppressive treatment of patients with moderate and severe systemic lupus erythematosus who did not show a satisfactory response to other immunosuppressives.;1998-2000

One hundred seventy-one SLE patients comprised the study population; 61 (55 girls and 6 boys) were African American with age at onset of 13 +/- 2.9 years, and 110 (97  girls and 13 boys) were Latin American (Colombian) with age at onset of 13 +/- 3.2 years. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data were obtained by chart review using a standard data collection form. African-American patients more commonly manifested discoid skin lesions, malar rash, pulmonary fibrosis, and pleuritis, and less commonly manifested photosensitivity, livedo reticularis, and vascular thrombosis than did Latin Americans. In addition, there was a higher frequency of anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, and anti-Ro positivity among African-Americans compared with Latin-American patients. These results suggest the presence of ethnic differences in the clinical expression of SLE. AD  - Department of Pediatrics, LSU Medical Center, New Orleans 70112-2822, USA.";1998-2000
398;Does sulphasalazine cause drug induced systemic lupus erythematosus? No effect evident in a prospective randomised trial of 200 rheumatoid patients treated with sulphasalazine or auranofin over five years.;1999;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Gordon MM;"BACKGROUND: Sulphasalazine (SSZ) has been reported to cause drug induced systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but diagnosis of this complication in the context of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is difficult. OBJECTIVE: To determine prospectively: (1) if patients become seropositive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) during prolonged treatment with SSZ without clinical evidence of SLE; (2) if ANA positive patients develop more adverse reactions than ANA negative patients; (3)  if drug induced SLE was identified in this cohort. METHODS: 200 patients enrolled in a randomised prospective trial of SSZ and auranofin (AUR) were followed up for five years. Baseline and annual ANA results were collected along with information on drug toxicity and reasons for discontinuation of treatment. RESULTS: Over five years 24 patients stopped taking SSZ and 49 AUR because of side effects. Of the features common to SLE, rash developed in nine SSZ patients and 11 AUR treated patients and mouth ulcers in three and four patients respectively. Six SSZ treated patients and three treated with AUR developed leucopenia, which promptly  resolved with drug withdrawal. No adverse event was ascribed to drug induced SLE. Of the 72 SSZ treated patients who were ANA negative or weakly positive at outset, 14 (19%) became strongly ANA positive compared with 11 (14%) of 80 AUR patients. Patients ANA positive at baseline or who became ANA positive were not more likely to develop drug toxicity or to withdraw from treatment than those ANA negative throughout. CONCLUSION: ANA positivity is common in patients with RA, but the presence or development of ANA did not increase the likelihood of withdrawing from treatment. No case of drug induced SLE was seen over five years  in this study.";1998-2000
399;Mortality and causes of death of 513 Danish patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1999;Scandinavian journal of rheumatology;Jacobsen S;A multicentre cohort of 513 clinic attenders with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was retrospectively identified, representing 4185 patient-years of follow-up. Expected numbers of death were calculated by means of age- and sex-specific mortality rates of the general Danish population. The observed number of deaths was 122. The survival rates were 97%, 91%, 76%, 64% and 53% after 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years respectively. The overall mortality rate was 2.9% per year (95% CI 2.4-3.5), and the standardized mortality rate (SMR) was 4.6 (95% CI 3.8-5.5). The causes of death included active SLE (n = 19), end stage organ failure due to SLE (n = 16), infections (n = 25), malignancy (n = 9), cardiovascular disease (n = 32), and other causes (n = 21). SLE was directly related to one third of the excess mortality. In conclusion, SLE patients in the  present cohort had a 4.6-fold increased mortality compared with the general population and half of the deaths were caused by SLE manifestations or infections, especially in young patients during the early period of the disease.;1998-2000
400;CYP2D6 polymorphism in systemic lupus erythematosus patients.;1999;European journal of clinical pharmacology;Kortunay S;OBJECTIVES: To determine whether patients with idiopathic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are associated with impaired CYP2D6 activity and to gain insight into whether there is an association between particular CYP2D6 genotypes  and susceptibility to SLE, and whether CYP2D6 polymorphism is linked to any specific clinical features of SLE. METHODS: Debrisoquine sulfate (10 mg p.o.) was given to 159 healthy volunteers and 39 idiopathic SLE patients. Genotypic assay was carried out in 80 healthy volunteers and 32 patients. A 10-ml blood sample was drawn for genotypic assay. Debrisoquine and 4-hydroxydebrisoquine were determined in 8-h urine samples. Blood samples were analysed for the presence of  mutations in the CYP2D6 gene, by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for CYP2D6*3 and CYP2D6*4 alleles. RESULTS: The metabolic ratio of debrisoquine to 4-hydroxydebrisoquine ranged from 0.01 to 86.98 in healthy subjects and from 0.02 to 96 in SLE patients. We observed the poor metabolizer(PM) debrisoquine phenotype in three of 39 patients with idiopathic SLE (7.6%) and five of 159 healthy subjects (3.1%). There was no significant difference in the frequency of  PM phenotypes between idiopathic SLE and healthy subjects (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.19). No significant difference in the distribution of overall genotypes and allele frequencies were observed between the two groups. No significant relationships were found between specific clinical features and the overall genotype. CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm that CYP2D6 activity is not impaired in SLE and that there is no association between SLE and phenotypic CYP2D6 status. The results also showed that there was no difference in the frequency of CYP2D6A and CYP2D6B alleles between controls and patients with SLE.;1998-2000
401;Osteopenia in young hypogonadal women with systemic lupus erythematosus receiving chronic steroid therapy: a randomized controlled trial comparing calcitriol and hormonal replacement therapy.;1999;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Kung AW;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of calcitriol and hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) in the treatment of steroid-induced osteoporosis in hypogonadal women. METHODS: We studied 28 young patients (aged 37 +/- 6 yr) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on chronic steroid therapy for 130 +/- 22 months and requiring more than 10 mg/day prednisone. They were amenorrhoeic for more than 2  yr with proven ovarian failure. All had osteopenia with a T score at L2-4 of less than -1. They were randomized to receive HRT (conjugated oestrogen 0.625 mg daily from day 1 to day 21 plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 5 mg daily days 10-21) or calcitriol 0.5 microg daily. All received calcium carbonate 1 g/day. RESULTS: There were no differences in the baseline demographic, bone mineral density (BMD) and biochemical data between the two groups. Lumbar spine BMD increased by 2.0 +/- 0.4% after 2 yr with HRT (P<0.05), but reduced by 1.74 +/- 0.4% (P<0.05) with calcitriol treatment. No change was seen at the distal one-third radius with HRT  treatment but significant bone loss (2.3 +/- 1.4%, P<0.02) was observed with calcitriol therapy. BMD at the hip did not change in both groups. Comparing both  treatment groups, significant differences in the BMD at the spine (P<0.03) and radius (P<0.05) were seen at the end of 2 yr. The changes in urinary n-telopeptide excretion but not serum osteocalcin at 6 months and 12 months were  inversely correlated with the changes in lumbar spine BMD at 24 months. HRT did not cause an adverse effect on SLE disease activity. CONCLUSION: HRT but not calcitriol could prevent bone loss in young hypogonadal women on chronic steroid  therapy.;1998-2000
402;A study of 20 SLE patients with intravenous immunoglobulin--clinical and serologic response.;1999;Lupus;Levy Y;OBJECTIVE: To test the clinical response of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients to intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg), and whether the clinical response of IVIg treatment in SLE is accompanied by modification of SLE-associated autoantibodies/antibodies (Abs) and complement levels. METHODS: Twenty SLE patients were treated with high-dose (2 g/kg) IVIg monthly, in a 5-d schedule. Each patient received between 1-8 treatment courses. They were evaluated for the  clinical response, Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM) score before and after  IVIg, levels of antinuclear antibody (ANA), dsDNA (double-stranded DNA), SS-A or  SS-B, ENA (extractable nuclear antigens), C3 and C4 levels before and after the treatment, and before and after each treatment course. RESULTS: A beneficial clinical response following IVIg treatment was noted in 17 out of 20 patients (85%). Few clinical manifestations responded more to treatment: arthritis, fever, thrombocytopenia, and neuropsychiatric lupus. In 9 patients evaluated before and  after IVIg, mean SLAM score decreased from 19. 3+/-4.7 to 4+/-2.9 (P<0.0001). There was a tendency towards abnormal levels of complement and Abs before IVIg courses among the treatment responders compared with the non-responders, and similarly the former tended to have normalization of their abnormal levels more than the latter. These differences were found statistically significant only with respect to C4 and SS-A or SS-B levels before IVIg courses. CONCLUSION: IVIg has a high response rate among SLE patients. A combination of clinical manifestations,  Abs and complement levels may aid in the future in predicting who among SLE patients will benefit more from IVIg treatment.;1998-2000
403;Prevalence of infective endocarditis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1999;Journal of the American Dental Association (1939);Miller CS;BACKGROUND: Compared with the general population, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, have an increased prevalence of functionally impaired cardiac valves due to the presence of Libman-Sacks lesions. These lesions may place patients with SLE at risk of developing infective endocarditis, or IE. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review to determine the association between SLE with valvulopathy and IE. They reviewed the records of 361 patients from two health care facilities who had the diagnostic code of SLE.  RESULTS: Of the 275 records that met the 1982 revised American Rheumatism Association criteria for SLE, 51 (18.5 percent) were for patients who had a clinically detectable heart murmur that resulted in echocardiography being performed. Nine (3.3 percent) of the 275 patients had a clinically significant valvular abnormality, three (1.1 percent) had a potentially significant valvular  abnormality, and one (0.4 percent) had a history of IE that was diagnosed two years before her diagnosis of SLE was made. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that 18.5 percent of this cohort of patients with SLE had a clinically detectable heart murmur that would require further investigation to determine its significance. Furthermore, between 3.3 and 4.4 percent of the study population had cardiac valve abnormalities that potentially required antibiotic prophylaxis  before certain dental procedures. However, the authors identified no cases that demonstrated an association between IE and diagnosed SLE. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:  Dentists should query their patients with SLE about their cardiac status and consult with the patient's physician if the cardiac status is unknown. Patients with confirmed valvular abnormalities should receive antibiotic prophylaxis for designated bacteremia-producing dental procedures.;1998-2000
404;Do flares of systemic lupus erythematosus decline after menopause?;1999;Scandinavian journal of rheumatology;Mok CC;OBJECTIVE: To study whether flares of SLE decline after menopause. METHOD: 34 postmenopausal SLE patients with premenopausal disease onset were studied. The frequency and severity of flares before and after menopause was compared. 17 postmenopausal onset SLE patients were also included for comparison. RESULT: Flares in postmenopausal SLE patients decreased significantly after menopause (total No. of flares/patient-year before and after menopause were 0.50+/-0.10 and 0.14+/-0.05, respectively, p = 0.002). The frequency and proportion of severe flares also dropped significantly. The rate and magnitude of postmenopausal flares in these patients were similar to those of the postmenopausal onset SLE patients, a subset known to run a more benign course. CONCLUSIONS: SLE flares less frequently and seriously after menopause. While this may suggest a protective role of hypoestrogenemia against lupus flares, the contribution of other factors like disease duration and effective treatment to this postmenopausal decline of flares cannot be separated from menopause per se. Further studies are needed.;1998-2000
405;Sample size considerations for superiority trials in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).;1999;Lupus;Moore AD;For reasons of efficiency and ethics, sample size calculations are an important part of the design of all clinical trials. This paper highlights the statistical  issues inherent to the estimation of sample size requirements in superiority trials particular to SLE. Calculations based on statistical power for testing hypotheses have historically been the method of choice for sample size determination in clinical trials. The advantages of using confidence intervals (CI's) rather than P-values in reporting results of clinical trials is now well established. Since the design of a trial should match the analysis that will eventually be performed, sample size methods based on ensuring accurate estimation of important parameters via sufficiently narrow CI widths should be preferred to methods based on hypothesis testing. Methods and examples are given  for sample size calculations for continuous and dichotomous outcomes from both a  power and confidence interval width viewpoint. An understanding of sample size calculations in association with expert statistical consultation will result in better designed clinical trials that accurately estimate clinically relevant differences between treatment outcomes, thereby furthering the treatment of patients with SLE.;1998-2000
406;Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus differ from healthy controls in their  immunological response to acute psychological stress.;1999;Brain, behavior, and immunity;Pawlak CR;Clinical observations suggest that psychological stress induces exacerbation of disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In order to determine whether SLE patients differ from healthy controls in their stress response, we analyzed heart rate, blood pressure, catecholamine concentration, lymphocyte subpopulations, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and expression of beta-adrenoceptors on PBMC before, immediately after, and 1 h after a public speaking task in 15 SLE patients and 15 healthy subjects. Both groups demonstrated similar psychological, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine responses  to acute stress. However, natural killer (CD16(+)/CD56(+)) cell numbers transiently increased after stress exposure, with significantly less pronounced changes in SLE patients. In addition, NK activity increased in healthy controls (n = 8) but not in SLE patients (n = 4) after acute stress. Furthermore, the number of beta(2)-adrenoceptors on PBMC significantly increased only in healthy subjects (n = 8) after stress but not in SLE patients (n = 7). These data indicate that SLE patients differ from healthy controls in stress-induced immune  responses.;1998-2000
407;Specificity of antibodies to bacterial DNA in the sera of healthy human subjects  and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1999;The Journal of rheumatology;Pisetsky D;OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the epitope structure to DNA by identifying antigenic determinants on bacterial DNA bound by anti-DNA antibodies from normal human subjects (NHS) and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Sera from NHS and patients with SLE were tested by ELISA for the presence of antibodies to single stranded DNA from calf thymus, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium perfringens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. To assess binding to conserved and nonconserved determinants, sera were absorbed  on DNA-cellulose affinity columns bearing each of the bacterial DNA and then tested for binding to the other DNA antigens. RESULTS: Absorption of SLE sera with any of the bacterial DNA caused a loss of binding to all other bacterial DNA as well as calf thymus DNA. In contrast, absorption of NHS sera with bacterial DNA caused a loss of binding to the DNA on the affinity column with much less effect on binding to the other DNA antigens. CONCLUSION: These results indicate a marked difference in the specificity of antibodies to bacterial DNA in NHS and patients with SLE. The binding of SLE anti-DNA to predominantly conserved determinants suggests that a shift in patterns of anti-DNA specificity may be associated with the autoimmune state.;1998-2000
408;Abnormal plasma and serum viscosity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): a Jamaican study.;1999;Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation;Reid HL;Vascular complications occur frequently in SLE, and their development may be related to haemorheological derangements. However, the range of rheological abnormality in Jamaican SLE patients have not been studied. The present investigation was aimed at determining the changes in the three major blood proteins, namely fibrinogen, albumin and globulin, and their effect on plasma and serum viscosity in SLE patients during the course of treatment. The concentrations of fibrinogen and globulin were significantly increased (p<0.001), while albumin was decreased (p<0.05) in the SLE patients as compared with the control group. This increase in the fibrinogen and globulin contributed significantly to the rise of both serum and plasma viscosity. SLE patients with more severe disease had higher serum viscosity values, suggesting that serum viscosity values may provide an important marker for disease severity.;1998-2000
409;Childhood-onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: clinical presentation and prognosis in 31 patients.;1999;Scandinavian journal of rheumatology;Rood MJ;OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical features at onset, the disease course, and prognostic factors in children with SLE. METHODS: The medical records of 31 patients with childhood-onset SLE were reviewed. Signs and symptoms at onset and  during the course of the disease were documented as well as survival and SLICC/ACR damage index. The disease course was compared to 135 consecutive adult-onset SLE patients. RESULTS: Childhood-onset SLE most frequently presented  with fatigue, arthritis, fever, weight loss, and malar rash. During follow-up, the frequency of the presence of malar rash, anemia, leukocytopenia, and anti-dsDNA antibodies was significantly higher in childhood-onset than in adult-onset patients. Mean SLICC/ACR damage index was 2.6 after 4.7 years of follow-up. The presence of arthritis, anemia, and seizures at the onset of disease resulted in a 2.6 to 3.9 times higher chance of a severe disease course.  CONCLUSION: Patients with childhood-onset SLE suffer from substantial morbidity.  Arthritis, anemia, and seizures at onset may be indicators of poor prognosis.;1998-2000
410;Anticardiolipin and anti-beta2GPI antibodies in a large series of European patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Prevalence and clinical associations. European Concerted Action on the Immunogenetics of SLE.;1999;Scandinavian journal of rheumatology;Sebastiani GD;OBJECTIVE: To test the prevalences and the clinical associations of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2GPI (abeta2GPI) antibodies in a large series  of European patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: 574 SLE patients from 7 European countries were tested for aCL and abeta2GPI by ELISA methods. RESULTS: aCL of IgG, IgM, and IgA isotypes were detected in 22.8%, 14%,  and 13.9% of the patients, respectively. IgG and IgM abeta2GPI were detected in 20% of the patients. The presence of aCL was highly associated with the presence  of abeta2GPI. Medium-high titer IgG aCL and abeta2GPI were associated with thrombosis, with similar sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. When present at medium-high titer, IgG aCL were associated with thrombocytopenia, IgM aCL with hemolytic anemia, and cerebrovascular accidents. IgA aCL with livedo reticularis and Raynaud's phenomenon. CONCLUSIONS: aCL, when present at medium-high titer, are as important as abeta2GPI, as a risk factor for thrombosis. Medium-high titer aCL, but not abeta2GPI, are associated with other clinical features of the antiphospholipid syndrome.;1998-2000
411;Pulmonary hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1999;Rheumatology international;Shen JY;A prospective echocardiographic and clinical study was performed on 84 Chinese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 99 controls to investigate the prevalence and the mechanism of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in SLE. Comparison between Doppler estimation and catheterization measurement was made in 12 cases to validate the predictive method. Compared to normal subjects, lupus patients had significantly increased systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) (29.59 +/- 12.52 vs 19.64 +/- 5.82, P < 0.001), mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) (15.11 +/- 7.36 vs 10.21 +/- 4.72, P < 0.001) and total pulmonary resistance (TPR) (315.85 +/- 190.65 vs 220.37 +/- 55.92, P < 0.001). Nine of the  84 patients presented PH, defined as SPAP < 30 mmHg and MPAP > 20 mmHg. Pulmonary hypertensive patients had higher serum endothelin (ET) than non-pulmonary hypertensive patients, were more commonly in active stages, and presented Raynaud's phenomenon and rheumatoid factors. ET level was correlated with echocardiographic pulmonary pressure. Pulmonary hypertension commonly occurs in Chinese patients with SLE (11%), and it correlates with the lupus activity and the elevation of serum endothelin.;1998-2000
412;Idiotypic vaccination with a murine anti-dsDNA antibody: phase I study in patients with nonactive systemic lupus erythematosus with nephritis.;1999;The Journal of rheumatology;Spertini F;OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and immunogenicity of an idiotypic anti-dsDNA  vaccine in patients with nonactive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and stable  lupus nephritis. METHODS: Patients with SLE with a history of nephritis were randomized for vaccination with the murine anti-dsDNA monoclonal antibody (Mab) 3E10 in a dose ranging, double blind, placebo controlled study (phase I). RESULTS: Of the 9 patients injected with Mab 3E10, 5 showed a human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response, in large part antiidiotypic, which developed within the first 3 months in 3 strong HAMA responders, and more than one year after immunization in an initially weak HAMA responder. All but one nonresponder were receiving low dose prednisone. No adverse events, in particular no evidence of lupus flares, and no untoward laboratory findings were reported over a followup of 2 years. CONCLUSION: In patients with stable lupus nephritis, immunization with Mab 3E10 appears safe and can generate a significant antiidiotypic response. Idiotypic vaccination may be an approach to specific immunotherapy of autoimmune  lupus nephritis.;1998-2000
413;The association of socio-economic status, race, psychosocial factors and outcome  in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1999;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Sutcliffe N;OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between socio-economic status, race, psychosocial factors and outcome in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: One hundred and ninety-five patients with SLE were studied at two centres in the UK (London and Birmingham). Information about sociodemographics, income, employment status, social support and satisfaction with care was obtained. Outcomes were assessed by end-organ damage, disease activity and employment status. RESULTS: Non-Caucasian race, longer disease duration, higher disease activity and lower level of education were associated with more organ damage in SLE. More satisfaction with access to care and interpersonal aspects of care, but less satisfaction with time spent with doctors, were also associated with more damage. Very long disease duration was associated with higher disease activity. Patients with higher disease activity, lower level of education and from the Birmingham centre were more likely not to be working due to their lupus. CONCLUSION: Race and socio-economic status, as well as clinical and psychosocial  factors, determine outcome in SLE.;1998-2000
414;Systemic lupus erythematosus: clinical features in patients with a disease duration of over 10 years, first evaluation.;1999;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Swaak AJ;OBJECTIVE: Most information available about the disease course of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is restricted to the first 5 yr after disease  onset. Data about the disease course 10 yr after disease onset are rare. The aim  of this multicentre study was to describe the outcome of SLE patients with a disease duration of >10 yr. METHODS: Outcome parameters were the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measure (ECLAM), the Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SLICC/ACR), a global damage index (DI) and required treatment. In 10 different European rheumatology centres, all SLE patients who were evaluated in the last 3 months of 1994, and who had been diagnosed with SLE  at least 10 yr ago, were included in the study. RESULTS: It should be stressed that our results are confined to a patient cohort, defined by a disease duration  of at least 10 yr, and who are still under clinical care at the different centres in Europe. These SLE patients still showed some disease activity, related to symptoms of the skin and musculoskeletal systems, next to the presence of renal involvement. A total of 72% of the patients needed treatment with prednisolone (</=7.5 mg). The cumulative damage was overall related to clinical features of the central nervous system (14%) and renal involvement (14%), next to deforming arthritis (14%), osteoporosis (15%) and hypertension (40%). The prevalences of obesity, Cushing appearance and diabetes are highly suggestive that the ongoing treatment and that in the past might have had an impact on the total sum of end-organ damage. CONCLUSIONS: After 10 yr, a high proportion of patients in our  cohort continued to show evidence of active disease, defined by the SLEDAI as well as ECLAM. The DI was related to the involvement of the central nervous system, renal involvement and the presence of hypertension.;1998-2000
415;Bone metabolism and bone mineral density of systemic lupus erythematosus at the time of diagnosis.;1999;Rheumatology international;Teichmann J;Recent studies have shown that systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with a loss of trabecular bone. However, these changes have not been not described in patients with SLE at the time of diagnosis. To investigate the markers of bone metabolism 20 female patients with a recently manifested clinical picture of SLE were selected. All patients included in this study met the ARA criteria (for classification) of SLE. For comparison, 35 female patients with SLE, which had previously manifested itself and which had been treated with glucocorticoids, were included in a second group. A control group (III) consisting of 20 healthy individuals of the same age was formed to compare the results obtained. Test parameters comprised both serum levels of osteocalcin (OC) as the marker for bone formation and crosslinks excretion (CE) in urine as a specific marker for bone resorption. The bone density (BMD) was examined by dual  energy X-ray absorption (DEXA) of the vertebral column (L2-L4), femoral neck, Ward's triangle and trochanter. The patients under study received either no medication or nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs. The BMD of the vertebral column was significantly lower than expected in SLE-afflicted subjects of group II when  compared with the age-matched normal female controls. The reduction of BMD in female patients with SLE was related to the significantly increased excretion of  urinary pyridinoline, to hypoparathyroidism, and to the decrease in serum OC. Bone loss in women with fresh manifestation of SLE (I) increases to a degree similar to that of patients in group II. Lowered BMD predicts an increased risk for bone fractures. Therefore, female premenopausal SLE patients should be monitored for osteoporosis. AD  - Medizinische Klinik III und Poliklinik, Justus-Liebig-Universitat Giessen, Germany.;1998-2000
416;Validation of the MOS SF-36 for quality of life assessment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in Singapore.;1999;The Journal of rheumatology;Thumboo J;OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability and construct validity of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) in a multiracial cohort of Asian patients with lupus in Singapore. METHODS: A cross sectional study was performed on 118 English speaking patients with lupus attending a specialist rheumatology unit between March and August 1996. Patients completed a questionnaire containing the UK standard version of the SF-36 twice within a 14 day period. All patients were assessed for disease activity using the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group score (BILAG), and for disease related damage using  the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) damage index (DI). Relationships between SF-36, BILAG, and DI scores were studied using Spearman's rank correlation. Internal consistency of the SF-36 was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, and stability using the repeatability coefficient of Bland and Altman. RESULTS: SF-36 subscales showed high internal consistency, with Cronbach's alpha coefficient ranging from  0.84 to 0.94. Test-retest reliability was acceptable, with Spearman's rank correlation >0.70 for all subscales except role-physical, and mean differences in test scores of <2 points for 5 of 8 subscales. SF-36 subscale scores were weakly  correlated with BILAG scores (Spearman's p -0.37 to 0.15) and SLICC/ACR DI scores (Spearman's p -0.25 to 0.23), suggesting divergent construct validity of the SF-36. CONCLUSION: These data suggest the SF-36 is a reliable and valid measure of the quality of life of patients with lupus in Singapore.;1998-2000
417;Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for active systemic lupus erythematosus.;1999;Rheumatology (Oxford, England);Traynor A;OBJECTIVE: For patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are at risk of disease-related mortality, we have initiated a protocol of intensive immunosuppression and haematopoietic stem cell support. The first patient enrolled in this study was in the midst of a lupus flare manifest by nephritis and rapidly declining renal function, uncontrolled hypertension, immune-mediated  cytopenias, and serositis characterized by a large pericardial effusion and abdominal pain. Antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA and complement were abnormal. This patient is now more than 1 yr post-stem cell transplant and is taking no immunosuppressive medication. Her serologies are normal, effusions have resolved, blood pressure is normal and renal function is markedly improved. The clinical and serological course of this patient is summarized here. METHODS: Autologous haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were mobilized with cyclophosphamide (2.0 g/m2) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (10 microg/kg/day). Stem cells were enriched ex vivo using CD34-positive immunoselection and reinfused after immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (90 mg/kg). RESULTS: White blood cell engraftment with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of  >500/microl (0.5 x 10(9)/l) and platelet engraftment with a non-transfused platelet count of >20000/microl (20 x 10(9)/l) occurred on day 10 and 14, respectively. Therapy was complicated by a cell lysis-like effect with hyperphosphataemia, hyperuricaemia, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis and transient exacerbation of renal insufficiency. CONCLUSION: This is the first autologous T-cell-depleted haematopoietic stem cell transplantation performed to  treat lupus in an active flare. This patient has, for the first time since discase onset (13 yr ago), entered a complete clinical and serological remission  which persists at >1 yr of follow-up. The durability of this remission is unknown.;1998-2000
418;A double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of dehydroepiandrosterone in severe systemic lupus erythematosus.;1999;Lupus;van Vollenhoven RF;OBJECTIVE: To determine if dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is beneficial in severe  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in 21 patients with severe and active SLE, manifestated primarily by nephritis, serositis or hematological abnormalities. In addition to conventional treatment with corticosteroids +/- immunosuppressives, patients received DHEA 200 mg/d vs. placebo for 6 months, followed by a 6-month open label period. The primary outcome was a prospectively  defined responder analysis, based on a quantitatively specified improvement of the principal severe lupus manifestation at 6 months. RESULTS: Nineteen patients  were available for evaluation at 6 months. Baseline imbalance between the groups  was noted, with the DHEA group having greater disease activity at baseline (P<0.05 by physician's global assessment). Eleven patients were responders: 7/9 patients on DHEA vs. 4/10 patients on placebo (P<0.10). Of the secondary outcomes, mean improvement in SLE disease activity index (SLE-DAI) score was greater in the DHEA group (-10.3+/-3.1 vs. -3.9+/-1.4. P<0.07). Bone mineral density at the lumbo-sacral spine showed significant reduction in the placebo group, but was maintained in the DHEA group. CONCLUSION: DHEA therapy, when added to conventional treatment for severe SLE, may at most have a small added benefit  with respect to lupus outcomes, but baseline imbalances in the study population limit the generalizability of the results. DHEA appears to have a protective effect with respect to corticosteroid-induced osteopenia in such patients.;1998-2000
419;HLA-DMA and HLA-DMB genotyping in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1999;The Journal of rheumatology;Yen JH;OBJECTIVE. To investigate the relation of HLA-DMA and DMB alleles to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: We studied HLA-DMA and DMB alleles in 108 patients with SLE and 138 healthy controls using the amplification created restriction site method. RESULTS: The phenotypic frequency  of HLA-DMA*0104 was significantly higher in patients with SLE than in healthy controls. The HLA-DMA and DMB alleles were not related to clinical manifestations and various laboratory tests in patients with SLE. CONCLUSION: HLA-DMA*0104 may be associated with the susceptibility of SLE.;1998-2000
420;Systemic lupus erythematosus in three ethnic groups: II. Features predictive of disease activity early in its course. LUMINA Study Group. Lupus in minority populations, nature versus nurture.;1998;Arthritis and rheumatism;Alarcon GS;OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors associated with disease activity in patients  with recent-onset (< or =5 years) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who were of  Hispanic, African-American, or Caucasian ethnicity. METHODS: Incident and prevalent cases of SLE, as defined by the American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE, among the 3 ethnic groups were identified in Alabama (The University of Alabama at Birmingham) and Texas (The University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center and The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston). Variables from the sociodemographic, clinical, immunologic, immunogenetic, behavioral, and psychological domains were obtained using validated instruments.  Disease activity was ascertained with the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM). Stepwise domain regressions with SLAM score as the dependent variable were performed. Final ethnic-specific and overall regression models were obtained by entering variables that were retained in the domain regressions. RESULTS: SLAM scores at study entry were higher in the African Americans (mean +/- SD 12.6 +/-  6.9) and Hispanics (11.0 +/- 6.2) than in the Caucasians (8.5 +/- 3.7) (P < or =  0.001). The final overall regression model (R2 = 28%) for higher SLAM score included the following variables: African-American ethnicity, lack of private health insurance, abrupt disease onset, presence of anti-Ro antibodies, absence of HLA-DRB1*0301, higher levels of helplessness, and abnormal illness-related behaviors. CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic, immunologic, immunogenetic, behavioral, and psychological variables were all predictive of disease activity early in the course of SLE, irrespective of ethnic group. However, there remain ethnic group differences in disease activity that were not explained by these factors.;1998-2000
421;Bromocriptine in systemic lupus erythematosus: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.;1998;Lupus;Alvarez-Nemegyei J;The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of bromocriptine (BRC) as an adjunct to conventional treatment in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled  study compared BRC at a fixed daily dosage of 2.5 mg with placebo. Patients were  followed for 2-17 months (mean 12.5 months). Disease activity was assessed using  the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), numbers of flares were recorded, and serum prolactin (PRL) levels were obtained at intervals during the study. Patients were allowed to take prednisone and immunosuppressive drugs. Sixty-six patients with SLE entered the study. Thirty-six were treated with BRC, and 30 controls received placebo. Sixteen patients were removed from the study during the treatment period: five in each group left the study because of adverse effects, five became pregnant, and one patient who took placebo died with central nervous system lupus. Four patients in the BRC treatment group and three patients in the placebo group moved away or stopped coming for study visits for unknown reasons, and were lost to follow-up during the course. At entry, serum PRL was (mean+/-s.d.) 24.8 ng/ml+/-18.4 in the BRC treatment group. This value fell to 5.8+/-9.0 after 12 months of treatment. Corresponding PRL values in controls were 23.7+/-22.1 pretreatment and 20.3+/-14 after 12 months. PRL levels in BRC-treated subjects were significantly lower than levels in control subjects after 3, 6, 9,  and 12 months of treatment. The SLEDAI score on the fifth protocol visit was decreased significantly in the BRC group vs controls: 0.9+/-1.4 vs 2.6+/-4.5 (P < 0.05). Although the absolute number of flares in each group was similar, the mean number of flares/patient/month was decreased significantly in the BRC group compared to the control group (0.08+/-0.1 vs 0.18+/-0.2, P = 0.03). Long term treatment with a low dose of BRC appears to be a safe and effective means of decreasing SLE flares in SLE patients.;1998-2000
422;Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus.;1998;Clinical rheumatology;Bakkaloglu A;We aimed to evaluate the presence of peripheral antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) in children with SLE and to correlate its association of laboratory findings. Twenty-one children with SLE were studied. Serum samples in patients were tested by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) slide kit (INOVA) for c-ANCA and p-ANCA and by ELISA for myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) and proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA). All the patients but two were quiescent for lupus at the time of sampling. Sixteen of 21 patients showed positive IIF staining whereas only 5 had MPO-ANCA and 2 of nine PR3-ANCA. The data suggests that SLE may be associated p-ANCA directed against additional target antigens rather than MPO and may be implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE or may be only non-specific antibodies developed in lupus.;1998-2000
423;Dehydroepiandrosterone in systemic lupus erythematosus: relationship between dosage, serum levels, and clinical response.;1998;The Journal of rheumatology;Barry NN;OBJECTIVE: To examine in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who participated in a clinical trial the relationship between daily dose of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), serum levels of DHEA and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS), clinical effectiveness, and side effects. METHODS: Twenty-three women with mild to moderate SLE were treated with DHEA for a 6 month period. The starting dose was 50 mg/day, and monthly stepwise increases were allowed. Subjects were assessed monthly by the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index, Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM), Health Assessment Questionnaire, and other outcomes. Serum testosterone, DHEA, and DHEAS levels were obtained and side effects noted monthly. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were found in all lupus outcomes over 6 months. Serum DHEA and DHEAS levels correlated with  the dose of DHEA. Serum DHEA and DHEAS correlated negatively with SLAM score. A second order regression analysis of serum DHEAS level versus SLAM score suggested that the optimal serum level of DHEAS was 1000 microg/dl. The most common side effect was acne. CONCLUSION: The clinical response to DHEA was not clearly dose dependent. Serum levels of DHEA and DHEAS correlated only weakly with lupus outcomes, but suggested an optimum serum DHEAS of 1000 microg/dl. Monitoring these serum levels appears to have limited clinical utility.;1998-2000
424;A pilot study of 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus-associated glomerulonephritis.;1998;Arthritis and rheumatism;Davis JC Jr;"OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and tolerability, as well as the clinical and  immunologic effects, of 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (2-CdA) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus-associated glomerulonephritis. METHODS: In a phase I study, 12 patients with proliferative lupus nephritis received 2-CdA either in weekly escalating intravenous treatments (0.15 mg/kg/week x 4, 0.1875 mg/kg/week  x 4, 0.225 mg/kg/week x 4; n = 5) or in a continuous 7-day infusion (0.05 mg/kg/day; n = 7). Safety, renal improvement, and immunologic effects were evaluated for 12 months. RESULTS: Patients treated with 2-CdA showed peripheral lymphocyte depletion without a significant reduction in neutrophil, monocyte, or  platelet numbers or hematocrit levels. Naive and memory T cells were decreased, as were lymphocytes with markers of early and late activation. Peripheral B cell  depletion was not associated with significant decreases in serum immunoglobulin levels. Continuous infusion induced better clinical responses than weekly infusions, as evidenced by 1) the percentage of patients showing complete response (43% versus 0%), 2) the percentage with at least 50% reduction in proteinuria (43% versus 20%), 3) the percentage with at least a 50% reduction in  urinary dysmorphic red cells (57% versus 0%), and 4) the percentage in whom cellular casts disappeared (43% versus 0%). Several infections occurred; these responded to standard antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, 2-CdA  was safely administered to 12 patients with lupus nephritis. It induced prolonged reductions in lymphocyte populations and may be efficacious in selected patients  with lupus nephritis when administered as a continuous infusion.";1998-2000
425;Epileptogenic activity of folic acid after drug induces SLE (folic acid and epilepsy);1998;European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology;Eros E;OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of folic acid-containing multivitamin supplementation in epileptic women before and during pregnancy in order to determine the rate of structural birth defects and epilepsy-related side effects. STUDY DESIGN: First a randomised trial, later periconception care including in total 12225 females. RESULTS: Of 60 epileptic women with periconceptional folic acid (0.8 mg)-containing multivitamin supplementation, no one developed epilepsy-related side effects during the periconception period. One epileptic woman delivered a newborn with cleft lip and palate. Another patient exhibited with a cluster of seizures after the periconception period using another multivitamin. This 22-year-old epileptic woman was treated continuously by carbamazepine and a folic acid (1 mg)-containing multivitamin from the 20th week  of gestation. She developed status epilepticus and later symptoms of systemic lupus erythematodes. Her pregnancy ended with stillbirth. CONCLUSIONS: The epileptic pregnant patient's autoimmune disease (probably drug-induced lupus) could damage the blood-brain barrier, therefore the therapeutic dose (> or =1 mg) of folic acid triggered a cluster of seizures. Physiological dose (<1 mg) of folic acid both in healthy and 60 epileptic women, all without any autoimmune disease, did not increase the risk for epileptic seizures.;1998-2000
426;Association of 16/6 and SA1 anti-DNA idiotypes with anticardiolipin antibodies and clinical manifestations in a large cohort of SLE patients. European Concerted Action on the Immunogenetics of SLE.;1998;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Galeazzi M;OBJECTIVE: The SA1 and 16/6 idiotypes can be found in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS). The aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of these idiotypes in a large cohort of SLE patients, and to determine whether their presence is correlated with the anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-dsDNA antibodies or with the clinical manifestations of SLE. METHODS: 492 SLE patients were evaluated for clinical manifestations of SLE and were assigned a disease severity score. ds-DNA autoantibodies, aCL autoantibodies of the IgM, IgG and IgA isotypes, and SA1 and  16/6 idiotypes were also determined in these patients. RESULTS: The prevalence of the SA1 and 16/6 idiotypes in the 492 SLE patients was found to be 11% and 5.1%,  respectively, and these idiotypes were significantly more prevalent in the patients who had aCL antibodies of either the IgG, IgM or IgA isotypes. Moreover, while the 16/6 idiotype was not associated with the clinical manifestation of either SLE or APS, the SA1 idiotype was found significantly more frequently in patients who had vascular events Raynaud's phenomenon or hemolytic anemia (p = 0.016, 0.01, 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: SLE patients with the SA1 idiotype  may run a higher risk of developing vascular events, Raynaud's phenomenon or hemolytic anemia. These clinical manifestations can be attributed to both SLE and secondary APS when aCL autoantibodies are also found. These results indicate that the possible pathogenicity of certain idiotypes in SLE cannot be excluded.;1998-2000
427;Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in 566 European patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: prevalence, clinical associations and correlation with other autoantibodies. European Concerted Action on the Immunogenetics of SLE.;1998;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Galeazzi M;"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate, in a cohort of 566 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) drawn from 11 European centres: (i) the prevalence of ANCAs and their subspecificities in a large series of European SLE patients; (ii) the possible associations of ANCA with the most common clinical manifestations of the disease; and (iii) whether ANCAs correlate with some of the autoantibodies commonly found in SLE. METHODS: ANCA detection was performed by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), and by ELISA for lactoferrin (LF), myeloperoxydase (MPO), proteinase3 (PR3) and lysozyme (LZ) subspecificities. RESULTS: The prevalence of ANCA was 16.4% (IIF). The prevalence of LF was 14.3%, LZ 4.6%, MPO  9.3%, and PR3 1.7%. Our results show that ANCA is associated with certain clinical manifestations of SLE. In particular, positive correlations were found between IIF ANCA and serositis (p = 0.026), livedo reticularis (p = 0.01), venous thrombosis (p = 0.03) and arthritis (p = 0.04), while anti-LF antibodies were associated with serositis (p = 0.05) and livedo reticularis (p < 10(-3). Nevertheless, multivariate analysis demonstrated that other autoantibodies, such  as aCL and SSA/Ro, are more closely correlated than ANCA with some of the aforementioned clinical features. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that ANCA are detectable in SLE sera and that some of them are associated with particular clinical manifestations. Whether ANCA plays a direct pathogenetic role in the vascular damage of SLE or only represents an epiphenomenon or a marker of disease activity remains to be elucidated.";1998-2000
428;Prospective randomized trial of two different immunoadsorbers in severe systemic  lupus erythematosus.;1998;Journal of autoimmunity;Gaubitz M;"Experiences with extracorporeal therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus have been published over the last 20 years and more. In addition to plasmapheresis, specific adsorption columns have been developed to deplete pathogenic antibodies  and immune complexes in the plasma of patients with SLE. We conducted a prospective randomized trial to compare the efficacy of a disposable adsorption column, which contained a specific ligand, phenylalanine (IMPH-350|Pt, Diamed, Koln, Germany) with a regenerable Ig-adsorbing column containing sheep anti-human antibodies (Ig-Therasorb|Pt, Therasorb, Munchen, Germany). Twenty SLE patients inadequately controlled with corticosteroids, anti-malarials, azathioprine or cyclosporine A, had strong evidence of disease in general, or an organ related SLAM score. They were randomized to receive either a perfusion of IMPH-350, or Ig-Therasorb, immunoadsorbed with 2.5 ml of plasma, three times each. The treatment regime was repeated after 4 weeks when the response was limited or non-existent. Response was defined as a reduction in the SLAM score of at least 30%. SLAM scores in the IMPH group decreased from 14.3+/-5.6 to 9.2+/-6.2 after 1 month and to 9.4+/-3.9 after 6 months; corresponding scores in the Ig-Therasorb group were 18.3+/-5. 5 to 11.2+/-7.6, decreasing to 9.2+/-2.9. After 1 month, 8/10 patients in both groups showed a response; after 6 months, 5/10 patients in  the IMPH-350 group and 8/10 in the Ig-Therasorb group fulfilled the response criteria. Reduction of dsDNA antibodies directly after treatment was 50.8+/-6.6%  in the IMPH-350 group and 61.0+/-8.0% in the IgTherasorb group. Results indicate  that immunoadsorption is an additional option in the treatment of severe SLE. Choice of type of immunoadsorber and immunosuppressive treatment has to take into account the severity and chronicity of common disease activity and organ involvement, as well as economic aspects.";1998-2000
429;A multicentre study of 513 Danish patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. II. Disease mortality and clinical factors of prognostic value.;1998;Clinical rheumatology;Jacobsen S;In this Danish multicentre study, predictive clinical factors of mortality and survival were calculated for 513 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 122 of whom died within a mean observation period of 8.2 years equalling a mortality rate of 2.9% per year. Survival rates were 97%, 91%, 76% and 64% after  1, 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively. The direct causes of death included SLE (n = 35), infections (n = 25), malignancy (n = 9), cardiovascular disease (n = 32) and other causes (n = 21). Uni- and multivariate analyses of survival and mortality were performed for all deaths and for SLE-related deaths. Azotaemia (one-fifth of the patients) was a strong predictor of increased overall and SLE-related mortality, but nephropathy per se (one-half of the patients) and large proteinuria (one-sixth of the patients) were unrelated to survival. Haemolytic anaemia had a significant negative influence on survival related to mortality caused by infections. Diffuse central nervous system disease and myocarditis were related to increased SLE-related mortality, whereas photosensitivity predicted a  decreased mortality. Non-fatal infections and thrombotic events predicted a decreased overall survival. Since 1980 the mortality caused by SLE manifestations has decreased significantly.;1998-2000
430;A multicentre study of 513 Danish patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. I.  Disease manifestations and analyses of clinical subsets.;1998;Clinical rheumatology;Jacobsen S;A Danish multicentre study was undertaken of the manifestations, infections, thrombotic events, survival and predictive factors of survival in 513 Danish patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) according to the 1982 classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. The mean duration of follow-up was 8.2 years from diagnosis and 12.8 years from first symptom. This paper describes the most common clinical and laboratory manifestations and their relationship to sex and age at the time of onset and diagnosis. Cluster analysis revealed three clinically defined clusters at the time of disease onset. Cluster 1 (57% of patients) consisted of relatively elderly patients without nephropathy or malar rash, but with a high prevalence of discoid lesions. Cluster 2 (18%) consisted of patients with nephropathy, a third  of whom also developed serositis and lymphopenia. The patients of the third cluster (25%) all had malar rash and half were photosensitive. Follow-up showed that the patients of cluster 2 developed azotaemia, large proteinuria, arterial hypertension and myositis significantly more often than did the rest of the patients, but the mortality was not increased. The risk of developing renal end-stage disease was highest in men with early-onset disease.;1998-2000
431;Placental pathology in systemic lupus erythematosus: a prospective study.;1998;American journal of obstetrics and gynecology;Magid MS;OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibody, often identified in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, are associated with poor pregnancy outcome. This study distinguishes between the effect of each of these factors on gestational outcome and placental pathologic conditions in pregnant patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-seven pregnancies and 40 placentas from 33 women with systemic lupus erythematosus were studied prospectively. RESULTS: Systemic lupus erythematosus alone, but not systemic lupus erythematosus activity, was associated with increased spontaneous  abortions, preterm gestations, and fetal growth restriction. Placental correlates were ischemic-hypoxic change, decidual vasculopathy, decidual and fetal thrombi,  chronic villitis, and decreased placental weight. Extensive infarction and fetal  death were important antiphospholipid antibody-related findings. CONCLUSIONS: Decidual vasculopathy/coagulopathy appears to mediate the antiphospholipid antibody-related and much of the systemic lupus erythematosus-related deleterious effect on the placenta and gestational outcome. The presence of antiphospholipid  antibody largely, but not invariably, predicts fetal death. Antiphospholipid antibody-independent chronic villitis may represent a second mechanism of systemic lupus erythematosus-related change.

432;Safety of hormonal replacement therapy in postmenopausal patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1998;Scandinavian journal of rheumatology;Mok CC;It remains controversial whether administration of exogenous estrogens is safe in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The current study was undertaken to determine the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the rate and magnitude of flares in a cohort of postmenopausal SLE patients. Thirty-four patients were prospectively followed. The frequency and severity of disease exacerbations in 11 patients who received HRT was compared with 23 patients who did not receive HRT.  Our results showed that both users and non-users of HRT had a comparable age of disease onset, duration of disease, clinical manifestations, and duration of follow-up. No significant increase in the rate (0.12 relapses/patient-year in HRT group vs 0.16 relapses/patient-year in the non-HRT group, p = 0.90) or magnitude  (total SLEDAI score increase during flares/patient-year in the HRT and non-HRT groups were 0.55 and 1.22, respectively, p = 0.57) of flares could be demonstrated in patients who received HRT over a median follow-up period of 35 months. We concluded that HRT appeared to be well tolerated and safe in postmenopausal SLE patients. Its potential beneficial effect may outweigh its deleterious effect on disease activity.;1998-2000
433;Bone marrow findings in systemic lupus erythematosus patients with peripheral cytopenias.;1998;Clinical rheumatology;Pereira RM;"We studied 21 bone marrow specimens from 21 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and peripheral cytopenias: anaemia (Hb < 10 g/dl), and/or leucopenia (white blood cell count < 4 x 10(9)/l), and/or thrombocytopenia (platelets < 150 x 10(9)/l). None of the patients had used immunosuppressive drugs in the 2 months before the study, and 11 (52.4%) had never used these drugs. The global and specific series cellularity, degree of fibrosis and necrosis were evaluated by bone marrow trephine; morphological abnormalities and  iron stores were evaluated by cytological smears. The most important abnormalities viewed in bone marrow biopsies were: global hypocellularity (47.6%), increased reticulin proliferation (76.2%) with myelofibrosis in one patient, and necrosis (19.0%). The marrow aspirates were difficult to obtain in four patients, who showed an increased reticulin proliferation on histological analysis. Plasmocytosis was present in 26.7% of cases and in one there was a serum monoclonal component (IgG kappa). Iron stores were normal or increased in 26.7% of specimens and decreased or absent in 73.3%. The most frequent peripheral abnormality was leucopenia in 90.4% (19/21) and granulocytic hypoplasia was observed in 47.3% (9/19) of these patients. We conclude that the bone marrow may  be a target organ in SLE with cytopenias.";1998-2000

435;Long-term thalidomide use in refractory cutaneous lesions of systemic lupus erythematosus.;1998;Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira (1992);Sato EI;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of long-term thalidomide treatment in cutaneous lesions of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), not responsive to conventional therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Were selected 18 SLE patients (ACR criteria) with active cutaneous lesions not responsive to chloroquine, photoprotectors and low doses prednisone and who presented good response to thalidomide but relapsed after withdrawal of the drug. All female patients had no risk of pregnancy. Thalidomide was reintroduced and maintained at low dose (25-100 mg/day) for a minimum of 6 months. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (16 females) with mean age of 34.2 yo (16-57 y.o.) received thalidomide for 6-21 months (mean 8.5 m). The mean dose of prednisone at beginning of study was 38.3 mg/d and at the end was 9.7 mg/d (p < 0.05). Complete remission of cutaneous lesions was observed in thirteen patients (72%) and partial remission in five (28%). Side effects observed were: drowsiness in eight patients, intestinal constipation in 5, transient oliguria in 1, paresthesia of hand with normal electromyography in another one. All side effects disappeared with reduction of thalidomide dose and no patient needed to stop treatment owing to side effect. CONCLUSION: Thalidomide is a good alternative therapy to SLE patients with refractory cutaneous lesions and without any risk of pregnancy.;1998-2000
436;Correlation of Fc gamma receptor expression of monocytes with clearance function  by macrophages in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1998;Scandinavian journal of immunology;Seres T;The expression of Fc gamma receptor II (Fc gammaRII) and Fc gammaRIII on monocytes in peripheral blood and the clearance of immunoglobulin (Ig)G-sensitized erythrocytes (EA) by tissue macrophages were investigated in parallel in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The relationship between receptor expression and the rate of clearance of EA (half-time) was analyzed. The detected decrease in mean fluorescence intensity of both FcR gammaII and Fc gammaRIII of patients' monocytes stained with specific monoclonal  antibodies (IV.3 and 3G8) was inversely correlated with the prolonged clearance half-time of 51Cr-labelled and anti-D IgG-sensitized autologous erythrocytes in these patients. A correlation was found between the impaired clearance function and the severity of the disease manifestation expressed by either clinical activity or renal involvement in our SLE patients. From these results it can be concluded that the in-vitro determination of monocyte Fc gammaRII and Fc gammaRIII expression may predict the in-vivo macrophage function via the same Fc  receptors.;1998-2000
437;A long-term study of hydroxychloroquine withdrawal on exacerbations in systemic lupus erythematosus. The Canadian Hydroxychloroquine Study Group.;1998;Lupus;Tsakonas E;The ability of antimalarials to moderate severe disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is plausible but undemonstrated. We evaluated the long-term effectiveness of maintaining treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulphate (HCQ) to prevent major flares in quiescent SLE. Forty-seven patients with quiescent SLE who had been randomized to take HCQ (n = 25) or placebo (n = 22) as part of a 24-week withdrawal trial were evaluated for an additional 3 years. The  primary outcome was time to a major flare of SLE which resulted in either the institution of or an increase in the current dosage of prednisone of 10 mg/day or more, or institution of therapy with immunosuppressive agents. Secondary outcomes included the specific subtype of these major flares (glomerulonephritis, vasculitis or other) and hospitalization for an exacerbation of SLE. An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted. Over the 42 months of study, 11 of 22 (50%) patients randomized initially to placebo, and seven of 25 (28%) patients randomized to continue treatment experienced a major flare. The relative risk of  major flare for those randomized to continue HCQ compared with controls was 0.43  (95% CI: 0.17, 1.12). The relative risks for subtypes of flares were 0.26 (95% CI: 0.03, 2.54) for nephritis, 0.51 (95% CI: 0.09, 3.08) for vasculitis and 0.65  (95% CI: 0.17, 2.41) for flares characterized by other symptoms. The relative risk of hospitalization for major flare for patients randomized to continue hydroxychloroquine was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.13, 2.60). While the results are not statistically significant, they are compatible with the clinical belief that HCQ  has a long-term protective effect against major disease flares in SLE and suggest that on average, HCQ use reduces major flares by 57% (95% CI: 83% reduction to 12% increase).;1998-2000
438;Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus with dehydroepiandrosterone: 50 patients treated up to 12 months.;1998;The Journal of rheumatology;van Vollenhoven RF;OBJECTIVE: To determine whether longterm therapy (up to 1 year) with the weakly androgenic adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is feasible and beneficial in patients with mild to moderate systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  METHODS: In a prospective, open label, uncontrolled longitudinal study 50 female  patients (37 premenopausal, 13 postmenopausal) with mild to moderate SLE were treated with oral DHEA 50-200 mg/day. RESULTS: DHEA therapy was associated with increases in the serum levels of DHEA, DHEA sulfate, and testosterone and, for those patients who continued DHEA, with decreasing disease activity measured by SLE Disease Activity Index score (p < 0.01), patient global assessment (p < 0.01), and physician global assessment (p < 0.05), compared to baseline. Concurrent prednisone doses were reduced (p < 0.05). These improvements were sustained over the entire treatment period. Thirty-four patients (68%) completed  6 months of treatment and 21 patients (42%) completed 12 months. Mild acneiform dermatitis was the most common adverse event (54%). Pre and postmenopausal women  experienced similar efficacy and adverse effects from DHEA. CONCLUSION: DHEA was  well tolerated and appeared clinically beneficial, with the benefits sustained for at least one year in those patients who maintained therapy.;1998-2000
439;Long-term treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus with cyclosporin A.;1997;Arthritis and rheumatism;Caccavo D;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of long-term treatment with cyclosporin A (CSA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Thirty patients with SLE whose condition was either poorly responsive or unresponsive to treatment with steroids and/or cytotoxic drugs were enrolled in a prospective, nonrandomized study of CSA. Patients with hypertension or hypercreatinemia were excluded. Disease activity was evaluated according to the systemic lupus activity measure.  Assessments were made prior to study entry and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients completed at least 24 months of treatment with CSA. The mean disease activity score significantly decreased after 6 months of therapy (P < 0.01); this result was maintained throughout the study. A conspicuous steroid-sparing effect was observed following administration of CSA (P < 0.01). Side effects included hypertrichosis (63% of patients), paresthesias  (23%), gastrointestinal symptoms (20%), gingival hyperplasia (17%), hypertension  (10%), tremors (7%), and nephrotoxicity (13%). No significant changes in serum creatinine levels were observed. CONCLUSION: CSA represents a helpful second-choice treatment for patients with active SLE. Administration of CSA necessitates expert and careful followup of patients.";<1997
440;Methotrexate in patients with moderate systemic lupus erythematosus (exclusion of renal and central nervous system disease).;1997;Annals of the rheumatic diseases;Gansauge S;"OBJECTIVES: Methotrexate (MTX) has been used in several autoimmune diseases. Apart from its use in rheumatoid arthritis, MTX has been assessed in small studies in patients with vasculitis, uveitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of MTX in a particular group of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PATIENTS: In an open prospective study 22 patients fulfilling the ACR criteria for SLE were included.  Patients had one or more of the following manifestations; active non-destructive  polyarthritis, dermatitis, vasculitis of the skin, pleuritis. All patients had been treated with corticosteroids for at least six months without achieving remission. Sixteen patients were taking antimalarial drugs in addition to corticosteroids, which were stopped at the beginning of the trial. Patients with  renal and central nervous involvement were excluded from the study. All patients  received MTX orally at a dose of 15 mg/week over six months. Corticosteroids were continued. As additional medication only indomethacin up to 100 mg/day was permitted if used before the start of the study. The outcome was evaluated using  the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI). RESULTS: Disease activity was evaluated  after six months of MTX treatment. All patients completed the study period. The SLEDAI decreased significantly from mean (SD) 12.2 (3.99) to 4 (3.75) (p = 0.001). The prednisolone dose was reduced from a mean (SD) of 17.4 (12.8) at the  beginning to 8.8 (5.36) mg/day at the end point of the study (p = 0.01). MTX was  well tolerated. Four patients complained of general malaise. Two patients had transient increases in liver enzymes. In no case did MTX have to be stopped. CONCLUSIONS: In an open prospective study methotrexate was used in SLE patients with particular clinical characteristics. MTX was shown to be effective in reducing disease activity and sparing the dose of corticosteroids. Further controlled studies are necessary.";<1997
441;The relationship of socioeconomic status, race, and modifiable risk factors to outcomes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1997;Arthritis and rheumatism;Karlson EW;OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship of race, socioeconomic status (SES), clinical factors, and psychosocial factors to outcomes in patients with systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A retrospective cohort was assembled, comprising 200 patients with SLE from 5 centers. This cohort was balanced in terms of race and SES. Patients provided information on socioeconomic factors, access to health care, nutrition, self-efficacy for disease management, health locus of control, social support, compliance, knowledge about SLE, and satisfaction with medical care. Outcome measures included disease activity (measured by the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure), damage (measured by the SLICC/ACR damage index), and health status (measured by the SF-36). RESULTS: In multivariate models that were controlled for race, SES, center, psychosocial factors, and clinical factors, lower self-efficacy for disease management (P < or = 0.0001), less social support (P < 0.005), and younger age at diagnosis (P < 0.007) were associated with greater disease activity. Older age at diagnosis (P < or = 0.0001), longer duration of SLE (P < or = 0.0001), poor nutrition (P < 0.002), and higher disease activity at diagnosis (P < 0.007) were associated with more damage. Lower self-efficacy for disease management was associated with worse physical function (P < or = 0.0001) and worse mental health status (P < or = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Disease activity and health status were most strongly associated with potentially modifiable psychosocial factors such as self-efficacy for disease management. Cumulative organ damage was most highly associated with clinical factors such as age and duration of disease. None of the outcomes measured were associated with race. These results suggest that education and counseling, coordinated with medical care, might improve outcomes in patients with SLE.;<1997
442;Methotrexate use in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1997;Lupus;Kipen Y;Low dose pulse oral methotrexate (MTX) is a well established treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and short term open studies have suggested beneficial effects of MTX in SLE. This study was designed to investigate MTX treatment maintenance rates in SLE using life table analysis, and to determine whether MTX  use was associated with a dose reduction of concomitant steroid therapy. All SLE  patients managed by physicians affiliated with a single centre were studied cross-sectionally. Information regarding disease variables and drug use were ascertained by interview and chart review. Drug therapy data including dates of treatment and indications for treatment were analysed using Kaplan-Keier life table methods. Among 101 subjects with SLE, 25 MTX treatment episodes were observed in 24 subjects. The period studied totalled 19766 patient-days, with a median (range) duration of observed MTX treatment of 14.4 (5.1-41.6) months. The  median (range) initial and peak MTX doses with 7.5 (2.5-10)mg/wk and 10 (7.5-15)  mg/week respectively. The principal indication for commencing methotrexate therapy was arthritis. Only two subjects terminated treatment for toxicity, with  the most common reason for termination being remission. The cumulative probability of continuing treatment was 68% at 12 months and 61% at 24 months, or 75% and 71% respectively if cessations for remission were excluded. The median (interquartile range) monthly steroid intake during MTX therapy [279.4 (193.4-492.9)mg] was somewhat lower than during the 6 months prior to [298.1 (237.9-531.4)428.8)mg] MTX therapy, but this difference was not significant. A total of 36% of subjects reduced their steroid dose during MTX therapy, but this  reduction was not significant. Treatment of SLE with MTX, predominantly for arthritis, was well tolerated over prolonged periods of observation. Toxicity of  sufficient severity to lead to treatment termination was uncommon. A subset of subjects were able to reduce steroid intake during MTX therapy, but no overall reduction in steroid dose was observed.;<1997
443;Systemic lupus erythematosus patients with respiratory symptoms: the value of HRCT.;1997;Clinical radiology;Ooi GC;Ten Chinese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and with persistent  respiratory symptoms were evaluated with high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), chest radiographs and lung function tests. Fourteen of 15 HRCT scans performed were abnormal. The predominant disease pattern, seen in 60% of patients, was one of chronic interstitial lung disease with honeycombing, architectural distortion, parenchymal bands, pleural irregularity, and a lower zone predominance. Three of 10 patients had histological evidence of either lung  fibrosis or interstitial pneumonitis. Airways disease and pleural thickening were seen in 20% and 87% of scans, respectively. Pleural thickening and honeycombing were present in 53% and 20% of chest radiographs, respectively. All concurrent lung function tests were abnormal. Reduced diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide  (DLCO/VA) was observed in 60% of lung function tests. There was no correlation between duration of disease and DLCO/VA. However, pathological reduction of DLCO/VA was seen in 71% of patients with honeycombing, and 88% of patients with ground glass opacity. Our study has documented a high incidence of HRCT features  of chronic lung destruction and a lower zone predominance in SLE patients with persistent respiratory symptoms.;<1997
444;Correlation between CD29 density on CD8+ lymphocytes and serum IgG in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1997;Lupus;Pallis M;The purpose of this paper is to establish whether there is increased lymphocyte adhesion molecule density in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which could alter the migration pathways and activation thresholds of lymphocytes and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. We analysed the CD11a, CD29 and CD2 bound antibody molecule (bam) density on the CD4+ and CD8+ CAMhigh (primed) lymphocytes of 28 SLE patients (8 active and 20 inactive by BILAG), using reproducible flow cytometric measurements, standardized with fluorescent beads and antibodies of known fluorescein: protein ratios. In a second patient cohort (17 patients), we investigated whether CD29 density on CD8+ cells correlated with measures of humoral (serum IgG) or cellular (urine neopterin) activation. In the  first cohort, 36% of patients had elevated CD29 (beta 1 integrin) density on CD8+ cells. In the second cohort, CD29 density on CD8+ cells was found to be closely associated with total plasma IgG (r = 0.71, P = 0.001), but not with urine neopterin, disease activity (BILAG) or drug treatment. We conclude that CD29 on CD8+ cells is associated with B cell activation in SLE.;<1997
445;Risk factors for early work disability in systemic lupus erythematosus: results from a multicenter study.;1997;Arthritis and rheumatism;Partridge AJ;OBJECTIVE: To study the risk factors for early work disability in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A sample of 159 SLE patients who had been employed  at some time since diagnosis was drawn from a multicenter study of outcome in SLE. Disease activity, organ damage, education, income, source of health insurance, and work-related factors were measured in a standardized interview. Work disability was defined by patient self-report of not working because of SLE. The outcome measure was current work status. Seven patients were excluded from the analysis because their choice not to work was unrelated to SLE. RESULTS: An average of 3.4 years after diagnosis, 40% had quit work completely, and job modification was substantial. Univariate analysis (chi-square and t-test) showed  that significant predictors of early work disability included having a high school education or less, receiving Medicaid or having no health insurance, having a job which required more physical strength, having an income below poverty level, and having greater disease activity at diagnosis. In multivariate  models, significant predictors were education level (P = 0.0004), higher physical demands of the job (P = 0.0028), and higher disease activity at diagnosis (P = 0.0078). Race, sex, cumulative organ damage at diagnosis, and disease duration were not significant. CONCLUSION: Early work disability in SLE is strongly associated with some sociodemographic factors that might be amenable to intervention.;<1997
446;Cytotoxic therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus. Experience from a single center.;1997;Medicine;Rahman P;The present survey of cytotoxic therapy from a single large lupus clinic has shown that approximately 33% of the patients have received cytotoxic therapy at some point in their course. These agents were initiated for a variety of manifestations, with renal manifestations being the major indication, accounting  for 28.2% of the cytotoxic agents used. Other common indications for initiation of cytotoxic therapy included steroid sparing (18.4%), global flare (12.5%), neurologic manifestations (11.4%), and musculoskeletal (8.6%). Azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide accounted for 98% of all cytotoxic agents used. Azathioprine was the most frequently used cytotoxic drug (70%), followed by methotrexate (21.5%) and cyclophosphamide (9.4%). Cytotoxic agents were used sequentially in 12.5% of patients and in combination in 4.2% of the patients. Overall, the use of cytotoxic therapy appears to be beneficial in reducing global disease activity, as the mean SLEDAI fell by 2.59 (33%) over 6 months of cytotoxic therapy, and the mean steroid dose was reduced by 37% over the same time period. There was also an improvement in most organ-specific indications with the use of cytotoxic agents. Overall the cytotoxic agents were well tolerated, with 17% of the courses being discontinued due to a side effect. Cytopenia was the most common side effect necessitating discontinuation of cytotoxic agents.;<1997
447;Echocardiographic findings, lipids and lipoprotein(a) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1997;Clinical rheumatology;Rantapaa-Dahlqvist S;Cardiac involvement, evaluated by echo-doppler-cardiography, occurred in 41 of 50 (82%) patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Valvular pathology with aortic cusp sclerosis was the most prevalent finding irrespective of age. This finding, suggestive of atherosclerotic heart disease, was supported by increased  levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in these patients. There was no significant increase in Lp(a) in the whole patient group, but Lp(a) was raised in patients with proteinuria. Forty percent of the SLE patients had pericarditis. Twelve patients with hypertension and/or mitral regurgitation had increased dimensions of left ventricle, left atrium or interventricular septum while 15 of  50 patients had isolated increase of these parameters. Localized hypokinesia was  found in nine patients. Reduced cardiac index was found in five patients with SLE. There was no association between valvular disease, increased pulmonary artery pressure, and anticardiolipin antibodies.;<1997
448;Cyclosporin and plasmapheresis in treatment of progressive systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE).;1997;Transfusion science;Schiel R;The prognosis of patients suffering from progressive systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) is poor, despite treatment with intensive drug regimens with combinations  of corticosteroids, azathioprine and cyclophosphamide. Side-effects such as infections and malignomas often occur. In the present trial, 21 patients (four male, 17 female, aged 37.9 +/- 12.8) suffering from pSLE for 9.4 +/- 2.6 years, were treated for 2.3 +/- 1.8 years with drug regimens as mentioned above. Then, over a period of 6.4 +/- 2.6 (range 1-8) years, in addition to conventional therapies, cyclosporin (2.5 +/- 0.6 mg/kg body wt/d) and, in active stages of the disease with extremely high concentrations of anti-ds-DNA-, anti-nuclear antibodies and circulating immunocomplexes, plasmapheresis (therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE)) have been applied. Compared with previous treatment modalities, significantly (P < 0.05) more effective and rapid reduction of antibodies was achieved. Clinical symptoms improved within 2 to 4 weeks. Under the new therapeutic regimen all patients reported increased performance and a better quality of life. After 5 to 48 (17.5 +/- 13.8) months, cyclosporin was established as mono-therapy for 8/21 patients. In] the other cases, corticosteroids, azathioprine and cyclophosphamide were reduced by 40 to 100%. No severe side-effects were seen. In acute stages of pSLE and in forms with persistently high antibody levels, the addition of TPE to conventional therapy was very effective, with regard to improving both clinical and laboratory parameters.;<1997
449;"Consistency and validity of patient administered assessment of quality of life by the MOS SF-36; its association with disease activity and damage in patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus.";1997;The Journal of rheumatology;Stoll T;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the metric properties and validity of the assessment of quality of life by the MOS Short Form 36 (SF-36) in patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and to examine the effect of disease on quality of life. METHODS: Cross sectional study of 150 patients with SLE (age: mean 39.7 yrs, SD 11.4 yrs; 95% female) attending 2 specialist lupus clinics between November 1994  and April 1995. Shortly before or after the consultation patients completed the SF-36 and the MOS SF-20 with an additional question about fatigue (SF-20+) in random order. Disease activity was measured by the British Isles Lupus Activity Group System (BILAG), disease damage by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) damage index (SLICC). RESULTS: SF-36 domains were shown to be internally consistent (Cronbach's coefficient alpha > or = 0.71). Significant associations of the SF-36 domains with the corresponding domains of the SF-20+ and with global disease activity measured by BILAG were observed. SF-36 scores in patients with SLE were  significantly lower than in controls. Different disease activity levels were significantly associated with different quality of life scores, with excellent ability to record the continuum from good health to serious illness by the SF-36. Disease activity had greater effect on quality of life than age, cumulative damage, or disease duration. CONCLUSION: This study shows the SF-36 is internally consistent and proves construct, discriminatory, and criterion validity for the SF-36 and construct validity for the SF-20+ in patients with SLE. The SF-36 is preferred because of its broader scope of questions, its widespread use, and previous international validation for a wide variety of diseases.";<1997
450;Association of the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index with measures of disease activity and health status in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1997;The Journal of rheumatology;Stoll T;"OBJECTIVE: To examine the internal consistency and validity of the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI) with respect to disease activity, health status, and medication score. METHODS: A prospective cross sectional study of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) attending a specialist lupus outpatient clinic between July 1994 and February 1995. The internal consistency of the SDI components was examined using Cronbach's coefficient alpha. The associations of the SDI components with disease activity measured by the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) index, health status measured by the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form 20, and with a medication score were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (p). RESULTS: 133 women and 8 men ranging in age from 20.1 to 88.7 years (mean 41.1, SD 12.5) were studied. With few exceptions, the components of the SDI that reflect damage in different organ systems were not associated with each other. We found a significant although weak relationship between some related SDI and BILAG components (p 0.25 to 0.28; p < 0.01). While damage to the musculoskeletal system was associated with limitations in physical  functioning measured with the MOS Short Form 20 (p-0.30; p < 0.01) and renal damage inversely with fatigue (p-0.23; p < 0.01) there was no significant relationship of other SDI components with the MOS Short Form 20. Renal and neuropsychiatric damage were associated significantly with the medication score (p 0.27 and 0.23; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The components of the SDI are valid in that they are associated with disease activity in the respective organ systems and some of them with a medication score. However, damage in different organ systems in SLE does not follow a common pattern. It is thus suggested that the SDI profile be used in addition to the SDI total score as an endpoint in clinical and epidemiological studies.";<1997
451;Avascular necrosis of bone in systemic lupus erythematosus. The predictive role of precipitating autoantibodies.;1997;Scandinavian journal of rheumatology;Watanabe T;The association between the type of precipitating autoantibodies and occurrence of avascular necrosis of bone (AVN) was examined. We prospectively analyzed clinical and laboratory findings of our 113 patients with SLE. Seven of 113 (6%)  patients developed AVN. Anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-RNP antibodies coexisted in 3 of  7 AVN patients. The same combination of these two antibodies were observed in 1 without AVN. Antibodies to topoisomerase I were detected in 2 other patients with AVN but not in any of the patients without AVN. The coexistence of the former two or the presence of the latter one is rare in SLE. However, these (combination of) antibodies can be useful as a local ischemic marker predicting the development of AVN.;<1997
452;Study of critically ill patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1996;Critical care medicine;Ansell SM;OBJECTIVES: To determine the presenting features, prognostic factors, course, and outcome of critically ill patients with systemic lupus erythematosus admitted to  the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN: Retrospective patient record review. SETTING: Two academic teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: All patients with systemic lupus erythematosus admitted to the ICUs between January 1982 and July 1993. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 28 female and two male patients. Fifteen patients were white, 11 patients were black, and four patients were Asian. The median age was 29 yrs. The reasons for admission to the ICU were multifactorial. However, most patients were admitted for infective, renal, cardiac, or coagulation complications. Despite aggressive management, 16 (53%) patients died in the ICU or shortly after discharge. The median ICU survival rate (admission to death) was 22 days. The only pretreatment factor that predicted a poor outcome was the presence of renal involvement due to systemic lupus erythematosus. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus admitted to an ICU often have florid disease manifestations with multifactorial reasons precipitating the admission. The prognosis for such patients is poor, particularly in the presence of renal involvement.;<1997

METHODS: Fifty-eight SLE patients were randomly assigned to receive a 6-month telephone counseling intervention using either a treatment counseling (TC) or symptom monitoring (SM) strategy. Health outcomes were assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales 2 (AIMS2). RESULTS: At the 6-month followup, the mean AIMS2 Physical Function scale and AIMS2 Social Support scale scores were significantly improved (P < 0.05) for  the TC group compared to the SM groups. The mean FSS score, AIMS2 Affect score, and AIMS2 Pain score were significantly improved (P < 0.05) for both groups.

454;Biochemical characterization of ADP-ribose polymer metabolism in SLE.;1996;Lupus;Chen HY;The metabolism of poly(ADP-ribose) in peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells was studied in 13 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and in 12 age  and sex matched controls. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity was measured as the net accumulation of ADP-ribose polymers during the conversion of 32P-NAD to poly(ADP-ribose) in PBM cells in vitro. The control population showed a mean activity of 418 +/- 91(s.d.)pmol ADP-ribose/10 min/10(6) cells. The SLE population was more heterogeneous and showed a lower mean of 225 +/- 147(s.d.)pmol ADP-ribose/10 min/10(6) cells. The mechanism of decreased ADP-ribose polymer accumulation was investigated. Measurements of turnover of the ADP-ribose polymers and its substrate, NAD+, showed that diminished ADP-ribose polymer accumulation in SLE subjects resulted from decreased poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis and not from altered rates of polymer turnover or NAD utilization. Western blot analyses of enzyme protein levels, kinetic studies of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity and analyses of polymer size distribution suggested that the mechanisms of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis in SLE cells is not altered but that the number of active poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase molecules is reduced.;<1997
455;Outpatient monthly oral bolus cyclophosphamide therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1996;The Journal of rheumatology;Dawisha SM;OBJECTIVE: An open label study to determine the feasibility and acute toxicity of a 6 month course of outpatient intermittent bolus high dose oral cyclophosphamide in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Oral cyclophosphamide in a single dose of 0.5 to 1.0 g/m2 was given monthly for 6 consecutive months. Disease activity was monitored by quantitative assessments of urine sediment, 24h urine protein excretion, and the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM). RESULTS: Twelve patients (11 with glomerulonephritis and one with thrombocytopenia) were studied. Improvements in SLAM scores, proteinuria, and urinary cellular casts were observed in the majority of the 9 patients with nephritis who completed the study. Adverse effects included mild nausea in most patients and intercurrent infections in 2 patients (herpes zoster, cellulitis, urinary tract infection). Three patients failed to complete the 6 month course of therapy because of treatment failure in the patient with thrombocytopenia, pregnancy, and severe vomiting, respectively. CONCLUSION: High dose pulse oral cyclophosphamide is an acceptable alternative for the aggressive outpatient management of selected patients with lupus nephritis.;<1997

The results of  a questionnaire regarding renal involvement.;1996;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Doria A;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the practice patterns in the management of lupus nephritis (LN) of physicians dealing with systemic lupus erythematosus. METHODS: A multiple choice questionnaire was sent to 135 lupus centers, mainly in Europe. It was divided into 4 sections, one of which regarded LN. Sixty-one centers (40%) sent the questionnaire back before the meeting; however two of them did not fill out the LN section. Therefore, 59 valid LN questionnaires were collected and analyzed. Statistical evaluation was performed using frequency analysis and the chi-square test. RESULTS: In 50 centers (85%), renal biopsy is performed in all patients with clinically evident renal involvement, and in most of them it is repeated in cases of relapse and/or ineffectiveness of treatment. Oral steroid alone is the therapy preferred by 67% of responding physicians in patients with WHO class II LN. Multi-drug therapy is favoured by 57% in patients with class III LN, by 79% for mild-to-moderate forms of class IV LN (IVm), by 84% for moderate-to-severe forms of class IV LN (IVs), by 47% for mild-to-moderate forms  of class V LN (Vm), and by 65% for moderate-to-severe forms of class V LN (Vs). Steroids plus cyclophosphamide (CYPH) is the association most commonly used for class III, IVm and IVs LN, having been indicated by 70%, 80% and 88% of the centers, respectively. Furthermore, pulse CYPH is largely preferred to oral CYPH  by the majority of centers. It is worth noting that 41 centers (70%, p < 0.01) utilise the same drugs in the treatment of both WHO class IVm and IVs LN. No clear trends in the use of multi-drug associations were identifiable in the treatment of class V LN. Moreover, most of the centers (64%) said that they rely  on histologic parameters in order to define renal prognosis and that they consider the chronicity index to be the best predictor of poor renal outcome (74% of the centers). CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to identify some clear trends in the behaviour of physicians who are ""expert"" in lupus patients: (i) they perform  a renal biopsy in order to charaterize the LN and repeat it when they are faced with relapse or ineffective therapy; (ii) they treat WHO class II LN with oral steroids alone and class III and IV LN with steroids associated with CYPH (CYPH,  generally in a pulse regimen); and (iii) they define renal prognosis by means of  histologic predictors, especially the chronicity index. However, no trend seemed  to exist for the treatment of class V LN, particularly Vm.";<1997
457;Comparison of clinical and laboratory parameters for systemic lupus erythematosus activity in Israelis versus Europeans.;1996;Israel journal of medical sciences;Levy Y;The clinical activity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be influenced by  ethnic and environmental factors. The Consensus group on Activity Criteria for SLE attempted in a multicenter study to determine well-accepted criteria for disease activity. Of the 704 randomly assigned patients, 41 (5.8%) were from Israel. A detailed history including epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data was recorded. Significant differences were found between Israeli and European patients in the occurrence of Raynaud's phenomenon [12 (30%) vs. 358 (51%), respectively (P < 0.05)] and skin vasculitis [6 (15%) vs. 216 (34%), respectively (P < 0.05)]. In addition to those clinical differences, significant  differences were also found in the occurrence of VDRL, low complement levels and  lupus anticoagulant. Additional differences were found in some laboratory data, indicating differences in the sensitivity of the various laboratories. We conclude that the differences between the Israeli and European groups in the clinical data can be attributed mainly to environmental factors (weather, viruses), and in the laboratory data to ethnic differences (e.g., HLA) and to the different diagnostic methods used.

458;The effect of person-centered counseling on the psychological status of persons with systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized, controlled trial.;1996;Arthritis care and research : the official journal of the Arthritis Health;Maisiak R;OBJECTIVE: We tested the effectiveness of a 6-month person-centered (PC), nondirective, telephone-based counseling intervention for improving the psychological status of persons with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: The design was a parallel-group, randomized,  controlled study comparing a PC counseling intervention (8 SLE, 28 RA patients) with usual care (7 SLE, 30 RA patients). The Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales  was used to measure psychological dysfunction, physical dysfunction, and pain at  baseline and at followup. RESULTS: The main finding was that the PC counseling intervention significantly improved the psychological status of the SLE patients  (P < 0.05, effect size = 1.13, responsiveness = 0.77) in comparison to usual care. There was no evidence of a benefit for persons with RA or of improvements in physical function or pain for persons with either disease.

During an observation period of up to 64 months and an average treatment period of 30.3 months, 16 SLE patients, who did not have adequate disease control or experienced side-effects with their previous immunosuppressive therapy, were treated with CsA (3-5 mg/kg). In 3/16 patients, CsA treatment was discontinued because of side-effects, in two because of inefficacy and in 2/16 because of a pregnancy. Four out of 16 patients had a flare of disease during CsA therapy 7, 24, 36 and 40 months after initial response to therapy; one patient stopped CsA treatment after 54 months of successful disease control. Four out of  16 patients are still on CsA. The best beneficial effect was observed in 10 patients with proteinuria, which decreased from 4.7 +/- 2.6 to 1.5 +/- 1.1 g/24 h. In 3/3 patients with thrombocytopenia and 3/3 patients with leucocytopenia, platelets and leucocytes returned to normal values. The most frequent side-effects were hypertension and deterioration of renal function (3/16) and hypertrichosis (5/16). According to the preliminary results of this study, CsA was well tolerated and able to control disease activity over an extended time period. These data should encourage investigators to perform a multicentre controlled trial on CsA therapy in SLE. AD  - Department of Internal Medicine III, University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany.";<1997
460;Clinical effects of intermittent, intravenous cyclophosphamide in severe systemic lupus erythematosus.;1996;Nephron;Martinelli R;"To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of intermittent intravenous cyclophosphamide in the treatment of severe systemic lupus erythematosus, 20 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and evidence of severe renal involvement or systemic vasculitis, consecutively admitted to the hospital were studied. Cyclophosphamide was administered intravenously at a dosage of 1.0 g/m2  monthly, during 6 months and maintained every 3 months during 12 additional months. Of 10 patients with active lupus nephritis, a reduction or disappearance  of proteinuria and maintenance of normal renal function was recorded in 6. Improvement of renal function was observed in 4 out of 7 patients with renal insufficiency at initial evaluation; resolution of renal insufficiency was more frequently observed in patients with recent onset renal failure. At the end of the follow-up (18.0 +/- 14.5 months) disappearance or reduction of nephrotic range proteinuria was recorded in 6 out of 14 patients; there was progression toward renal failure in 4 patients (20%). Response to intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy was observed in 4 of 5 patients with severe extrarenal SLE. Side effects, recorded in 12 patients, were mild and transient and in no patient was the treatment discontinued. Four patients died during the follow-up,  although in 2 of them the deaths were not attributable to therapy. Even though this was an open and uncontrolled study, intermittent, intravenous cyclophosphamide was an effective therapy for severe, steroid refractory SLE.

461;Ultraviolet-A1 (340-400 nm) irradiation therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1996;Lupus;McGrath H;"Ultraviolet-A1 (UV-A1) wavelengths have been found effective in mitigating signs  and symptoms of disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but studies have been uncontrolled. To rigorously assess the effectiveness and safety of daily low-dose UV-A1 irradiation as a therapeutic agent in this disorder we enrolled 26 women with SLE in an 18-week two-phase study. During the initial six-week prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, the patients were divided into two groups; Group A was exposed to 60kJ/m2 of UV-A1 (340-400 nm) irradiation within a sunbed five days a week for three weeks and Group B was exposed for an equal amount of time to visible light of greater than > 430 nm (placebo). Each group was then crossed over for exposure to the other source for  three weeks. During the second phase-2 weeks-patients and physicians were unblinded and patients were irradiated with progressively decreasing levels of UV-A1 only. Twenty-five patients completed the six-week placebo-controlled phase  of the study and eighteen patients participated for the entire 18 weeks. In Group A the systemic lupus activity measure (SLAM) score improved significantly after three weeks of five-day-a-week UV-A1 irradiation (P < 0.05), regressing to baseline during the three weeks of placebo irradiation. Improvement recurred and  progressed with six weeks of three-day-a-week UV-A1 irradiation (P < 0.05). Group B patients responded negligibly to the three weeks of visible light, more sharply to UV-A1, and as with Group A, maximally to the six weeks of three-day-a-week UV-A1 (P < 0.01). With twice- and then once-weekly UV-A1 irradiation the SLAM scores worsened slightly. All patients decreased their drug use. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA) decreased significantly (P < 0.05) and anti-nuclear antibodies non-significantly. Side effects were negligible. Visible light had no significant effect. In conclusion, low-dose UV-A1 irradiation effectively, comfortably, and without apparent toxicity diminished signs and symptoms of disease activity in SLE.";<1997
462;Controlled trial with chloroquine diphosphate in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1996;Lupus;Meinao IM;INTRODUCTION: Antimalarials have been recognized as effective drugs for the treatment of articular and cutaneous manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but its potential in the management of systemic features of  the disease has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. OBJECTIVES: This study intended to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine diphosphate (CDP) in preventing  flares and in reducing the maintenance corticosteroid dose in patients with SLE without life-threatening manifestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four SLE patients with no life-threatening manifestation were enrolled in a 12-month double blind placebo-controlled trial with CDP (250 mg/day). Patients were subjected each month to clinical examination by a rheumatologist and to SLE-relevant laboratory tests. At each visit, prednisone dose could be adjusted according to the clinical status. Ophthalmologic examination was performed every  six months. Outcome measures included SLEDAI score and the required prednisone dose. SLE flare was defined as an increase in SLEDAI score of at least three points. Prednisone dose reduction was defined as a minimum 50% dose decrease with no concomitant disease flare. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients completed the study. One patient in the placebo (PL) group dropped out due to severe dyspepsia. No major side-effect was observed in the remaining patients. PL and CDP groups showed no significant difference at the beginning of the study with regard to sex, age, ethnic classification, disease duration, SLEDAI and prednisone dose. Along the trial the prednisone dose became progressively lower in CDP group as compared to PL group and the difference reached statistical significance at 4, 6  and 12 months. SLEDAI score was higher in PL group in all evaluations, being the  difference statistically significant at 4 months. Flare-up episodes were registered in two patients in CDP group and in ten patients in PL group. The estimated reactivation risk was 4.6 times greater in PL group as compared to CDP  group. CONCLUSIONS: CDP at a 250 mg/day dose was able to prevent disease exacerbation, reduce the required prednisone dose, and help inducing a better control of patients with non life-threatening SLE. These data suggest that antimalarials might have a broader indication in the treatment of SLE other than  solely the management of skin and articular manifestations.;<1997
463;Systemic lupus erythematosus in males. A study of 107 Latin American patients.;1996;Medicine;Molina JF;Clinical and laboratory features were analyzed in 107 Latin American male patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who were compared with a group of 1,209 Latin American female patients with SLE to determine the presence of gender-associated differences. Males had an increased prevalence of renal disease, vascular thrombosis, and the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies, as well  as the use of moderate to high doses of corticosteroids, compared with female SLE patients. Although there was no difference in mortality from all causes, SLE-related mortality was higher in the male group. All these findings are consistent with a more severe disease in Latin American males than in female patients from the same region.;<1997
464;CD45 isoforms expression on CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral blood T-lymphocytes is related to auto-immune processes and hematological manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1996;Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift;Neidhart M;"We investigated whether, in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the CD45 isoforms expression on peripheral blood T-lymphocytes (T-PBL) is related to the auto-immune processes and hematological manifestations. The CD45RA/RO patterns of CD4+ and CD8 bright+ T-PBL were determined by three-colour flow cytometry. The serum levels of anti-nuclear (ANA), anti-double stranded DNA (ds DNA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL) autoantibodies were quantified by ELISA. The hematological  parameters were routinely assessed. 72% of SLE patients (n = 29) had reduced lymphocyte counts, which correlated with more severe physician's assessment of disease activity, increased ANA and anti-ds DNA auto-antibodies. The lymphopenia  preferentially affected the CD4+ T-PBL and, among them, the ""naive"" CD45RA+, RO-  cells. Thus, compared with healthy women (n = 29), SLE patients had less naive and more ""transient"" CD45RA+, RO+ cells among CD4+ T-PBL. Meanwhile, on average,  the CD45 isoforms expression on CD8+ T-PBL was unchanged. Interestingly, in 3 patients who were repeatedly evaluated, increases of transient CD8+ T-PBL paralleled the elevation of anti-ds DNA. In addition, high anti-CL was associated with more transient CD4+ and CD8+ T-PBL. The loss of naive and increase of transient CD8+ T-PBL was associated with increased disease activity and possibly  hemolytic anemia. Thus, in SLE, the enhanced phenotypic switch from naive CD45RA+, RO- to ""memory"" CD45RO+ T-PBL patterns paralleled the auto-immune processes characteristic of this disease.";<1997
465;Hydroxychloroquine in pregnant patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1996;The Journal of rheumatology;Parke A;OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety for both mother and fetus of antimalarial drugs, i.e., chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, in pregnant patients with lupus  who continued antimalarial drugs throughout pregnancy. Stopping antimalarial drugs can precipitate disease flares of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which are known to be detrimental to the outcome of pregnancy in patients with SLE. Stopping antimalarial drugs during pregnancy therefore not only puts the mother's health at risk but can also compromise the outcome of pregnancy. METHODS: We document 9 pregnancies in 8 patients with lupus, all of whom took hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) throughout pregnancy. All 9 pregnancies, which occurred since our first report in 1988, resulted in 9 live births (4 full term and 5 preterm). RESULTS: No congenital abnormalities occurred and mean followup of 33 months (range 10-72 months) revealed no abnormalities in these children. Temporary discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine for 1 month precipitated a flare  of disease in one mother, documented both clinically and serologically. CONCLUSION: It is safer to continue hydroxychloroquine rather than to discontinue this drug simply because of pregnancy.;<1997
466;Pulse cyclophosphamide in the treatment of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus.;1996;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Ramos PC;OBJECTIVE: The effect of pulse cyclophosphamide treatment was retrospectively assessed in 25 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with central nervous system involvement. All patients who tested positive for anti-phospholipid antibodies and/or lupus anticoagulant were excluded. RESULTS: Low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide pulses (500 mg) were administered weekly in all patients. Twenty-four out of 25 patients attained a good response (after a mean of 11 days). Cyclophosphamide was well tolerated in all patients with only minor  side effects. None of the patients experienced ovarian failure, cystitis or herpes zoster. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly low-dose cyclophosphamide pulses appear to be  safe and effective for the management of neuropsychiatric manifestations in SLE patients without antiphospholipid antibodies.;<1997
467;Respiratory function in systemic lupus erythematosus: relation with activity and  severity.;1996;Lupus;Rolla G;The objective of this study was to examine the relation between respiratory function tests, disease activity and disease severity in ambulatory patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who did not present with overt respiratory problems. Lung volumes, maximal expiratory flows at 50% and 25% of vital capacity (MEF50 and MEF25), bronchial threshold to methacholine (PD15FEV1), transfer factor CO (KCO) were measured in 24 consecutive SLE outpatients (22 women, age 41 +/- 14.8 years) and in 24 healthy controls matched for age and sex. In SLE patients alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (AaO2) was also measured. Disease activity was assessed by European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement (ECLAM) scoring system and disease severity by Lupus Severity of Disease Index. In comparison to controls SLE patients showed a significant decrease of total lung capacity (TLC) (91.7 +/- 16.5 vs 102.7 +/- 12.9% predicted, P < 0.01), MEF25 (58.4 +/- 25.2 vs 73.5 +/- 19.5% predicted, P < 0.005) PD15FEV1 (2164 +/- 1122 vs 4230 +/- 1014 micrograms methacholine, P < 0.0001) and KCO (77.1 +/- 20.5 vs 96.3 +/- 12.4% predicted, P < 0.001). AaO2 (mean value 13.2 +/- 8.4) was abnormally high (> 20 mmHg) in 12 patients. The ECLAM score of activity was inversely related with KCO (r = 0.48, P < 0.02). The severity index was significantly related with FEV1/VC ratio (r = 0.43, P < 0.05), MEF50 (r = 0.51, P < 0.01), MEF25 (r = 0.40, P < 0.05) and PD15FEV1 (r = 0.51, P < 0.01). In eight patients,  evaluated also after treatment intensification, there was a significant increase  in KCO (from 71.8 +/- 24.7 to 84.9 +/- 22.3% predicted, P < 0.01) along with a decrease in ECLAM score (from 3.0 +/- 1.34 to 0.69 +/- 0.75, P < 0.01). The relation between disease activity and KCO suggests a relation between systemic and alveolar inflammation whereas the relation between severity index, airway patency and reactivity indices suggests a cumulative damage to the airways in SLE patients, even in the absence of overt respiratory manifestations.;<1997
468;Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate is positively correlated with soluble interleukin  2 receptor and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1996;The Journal of rheumatology;Straub RH;"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is linked  with soluble immune mediators in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: DHEAS and various soluble immune mediators were measured by ELISA in the serum of 35 patients with SLE (26 women, 9 men) and in 41 control subjects. RESULTS: DHEAS was lower in patients with SLE compared to controls (male 1.29 +/- 0.32 vs 3.04 +/- 0.33 micrograms/ml, p < 0.001; female 0.75 +/- 0.12 vs 2.16 +/- 0.18 micrograms/ml, p < 0.001). The DHEAS reduction was in part dependent on prior glucocorticosteroid treatment (p < 0.02). After adjustment for multiple comparisons, there was significant negative correlation between steroid dose and  DHEAS (RRank = -0.426, p = 0.005), but with none of the soluble immune mediators. No significant difference in the percentage of steroid treated male and female patients was found (p = 0.220). However, there was positive correlation between DHEAS and soluble interleukin 2 receptor in women, but not in men, with SLE [RRank = 0.747 (n = 26, p < 0.0001) vs RRank = -0.1333( n = 9, p = 0.366)] and between DHEAS and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule in women, but not in men, with SLE [RRank = 0.509 (n = 26, p = 0.005) vs RRank = 0.4833 (n = 9, p = 0.094)]. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate positive interrelation between DHEAS  and soluble immune mediators involved in leukocyte function and leukocyte adhesion only in female patients with SLE.";<1997
469;Anti-DNA antibody kinetics following selective removal by adsorption using dextran sulphate cellulose columns in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1996;Journal of clinical apheresis;Suzuki K;The aim of this study is to determine by mathematical analysis which of two models, the one- or the two-compartment model, more closely approximates the kinetics of anti-dsDNA following immunoadsorption procedures in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Titers of anti-dsDNA were measured at specified intervals after apheresis to each model by nonlinear least-squares methods, and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) was calculated to determine which model most approximately described the kinetics. The AIC of the two-compartment model was larger than that of the one-compartment model in all 14 SLE patients (P < .001).  Therefore, the one-compartment model is thought to be suitable. The generation rate and catabolic rate of anti-dsDNA were obtainable using this model. The anti-dsDNA replenishment curve after an immunoadsorption session was defined by only two parameters: the generation and catabolic rates of anti-dsDNA.;<1997
470;International survey on the management of patients with SLE. II. The results of a questionnaire regarding neuropsychiatric manifestations.;1996;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Tincani A;"OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic and therapeutic approach used in clinical  practice for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with primary SLE-mediated neuropsychiatric (NP) manifestations. METHODS: A questionnaire was drawn up to assess how clinicians manage various clinical manifestations of SLE. A portion of this questionnaire was designed to assess how clinicians diagnose and treat primary NP-SLE. Most of the questions in the NP-SLE section consisted of lists of different clinical manifestations and laboratory or radiological studies that participants were asked to rate on a scale of importance [from 1 (extremely important) to 5 (not important)] to the diagnosis of primary NP-SLE. The questionnaire also assessed how different NP manifestations are treated in clinical practice. The relative importance of each  clinical manifestation was determined through its mean score, and the agreement among participants on each issue was determined using the coefficient of variation (CV). Fifty-nine lupus centers participated in the NP-SLE portion of the survey. RESULTS: The clinical manifestations which were considered to be of extreme or major importance for the diagnosis of primary NP-SLE were seizures, psychosis, transverse myelitis, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) and aseptic meningitis. Among the radiological and laboratory studies, only brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) achieved ""extremely important"" mean scores (between 1 and 2). aPL testing was used routinely in the majority of patients (mean 96.8%; CV = 0.1), while brain MRI was used less frequently (mean 56.5%; CV = 0.61). Only brain MRI and cerebral angiography were considered to be helpful in differentiating cerebral vasculopathy from multi-infarct (mean score = 1.6 and 1.9, respectively), whereas a prompt response to treatment with increased doses of steroids was considered helpful in differentiating SLE-related psychosis from steroid-induced psychosis (mean score = 1.58). The results of aPL testing, coagulation tests for the lupus  anticoagulant, an brain MRI were considered to be of extreme or major importance  in decisions involving treatment with anticoagulant or anti-platelet therapy. Symptomatic therapies, such as heparin, or anti-convulsant, anti-platelet, oral anticoagulant, and antipsychotic therapy were the most widely used. Corticosteroids were the most frequently used immunosuppressive therapy. The administration of other immunosuppressive agents as specific treatment for NP-SLE was uncommon. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey found that in clinical practice, the NP manifestations currently considered to be diagnostic of primary SLE-mediated CNS  involvement are not limited to those included in the American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria, e.g. seizures and psychosis. Antiphospholipid antibodies appeared to be the laboratory parameter most frequently relied upon in the diagnosis of NP-SLE, and in decisions regarding treatment. Apart from that, only brain MRI and, in selected cases, cerebral angiography seemed to be of real  help in diagnosis. The lack of consensus regarding the treatment of primary NP-SLE manifestations most probably reflects both the complex nature of neurological illness in SLE patients and the lack of clear diagnostic criteria.";<1997
471;SS-A/Ro antibodies in Chinese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome.;1996;Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi;Tsay GJ;Serum from 53 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 23 patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) were studied for anti-52-kDa SS-A/Ro, anti-60-kDa SS-A/Ro, and anti-SS-B/La antibodies by immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By immunoblotting, anti-SS-A/Ro was detected in 16 (30%) patients with SLE and 17 (74%) patients with SS. Anti-SS-B/La was detected in 22 (41%) patients with SLE and 15 (65%) patients with SS. Serum from 14 of the 16 SLE patients with anti-SS-A/Ro reacted with the  60-kDa protein and 15 serum samples from these patients recognized the 52-kDa protein. Serum with anti-60-kDa SS-A/Ro alone was not found. Serum from all of the 17 SS patients with anti-SS-A/Ro reacted with the 52-kDa protein, whereas serum from only two of these patients recognized the 60-kDa protein. By ELISA, the frequency of anti-SS-A/Ro (antibodies to the 60-kDa and/or 52-kDa of SS-A/Ro  proteins) in patients with SLE and SS was 43/53 (81%) and 15/23 (65%), respectively. Anti-48-kDa SS-B/La was found in 28% and 48% of SLE and SS patients, respectively. Serum from 77% of SLE patients and 48% of SS patients reacted with the 60-kDa SS-A/Ro protein. Serum from 45% of SLE patients and 52% of SS patients reacted with the 52-kDa SS-A/Ro protein. Patients with SLE had significantly higher titers of antibodies to 60-kDa SS-A/Ro compared with patients with SS. Anti-SS-A/Ro and anti-SS-B/La are common in both SLE and SS. The different reactivities of anti-52-kDa and anti-60-kDa antibodies in serum from patients with SLE and SS may represent differences in conformation-dependent epitopes of SS-A/Ro autoantigens.;<1997
472;International survey on the management of patients with SLE. I. General data on the participating centers and the results of a questionnaire regarding mucocutaneous involvement.;1996;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Vitali C;"OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis and treatment of the mucocutaneous (MC), neuropsychiatric (NP), and renal (RN) manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remain unsolved issues. To shed light on these issues, a questionnaire was prepared and sent to 153 lupus centres around the world, in order to determine the level of agreement between experts in their approach to these complex aspects of the disease. METHODS: The first section of the questionnaire was designed to collect information on the characteristics of the responding lupus centres. The second section was dedicated to MC manifestations,  with questions focusing on: (i) the frequency of MC manifestations as a whole and of the single clinical MC entities; (ii) clinical features, outcome and therapy of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE); (iii) the utility of the lupus  band test (LBT); and (iv) the use of various therapeutic protocols to treat MC manifestations. RESULTS: Sixty-one questionnaires from 19 countries were analysed. Out of these, 37 were completed by Departments of Rheumatology, 21 by Departments of Internal Medicine or Clinical Immunology, and 3 by Departments of  Nephrology. About 66% of these centres stated that they were currently following  more than 100 lupus cases, 95% had an in-patient ward and 82% had their own laboratory. The American College of Rheumatology classification criteria and various scales for disease activity assessment were regularly used by 87% and 57% of centres respectively. The overall prevalence of MC manifestations was judged to be over 30% by 82% of the respondents (Rs), and over 60% by 36% of the Rs. Among the different MC manifestations, malar rash was reported to be the most frequent (40%), followed by alopecia (24.1%) and oral ulcers (18.6%). In reporting the prevalence of each MC manifestation, the Rs showed a low level of agreement, the coefficient of variation (CV) being > 0.75 for all of the manifestations listed with the exception of malar rash (CV = 0.54). Poor agreement among centers was also found for the reported association of various MC manifestations with SCLE (15 different answers), and on the prognostic factors for SCLE (17 different answers). There was agreement on the best procedure (up to 70% of the Rs preferred a non-UV exposed skin area) and on the utility of the LBT (83% using it only for diagnostic purpose). Hydroxychloroquine was the most popular therapeutic protocol, being used by 85% of the Rs for a wide variety of MC manifestations. Among other therapies, azathioprine was used by 59%, dapsone by 41%, and thalidomide by 35% of the Rs, all to treat a wide spectrum of MC manifestations. Pulse steroid, cyclosporin A and pulse cyclophosphamide were less commonly employed (by 27%, 22% and 13% of the Rs, respectively), and were reserved for the most severe MC manifestations, particularly vasculitis. CONCLUSION: The present survey indicates that, although most of the participating centres had extensive experience in the management of SLE, their approach to the  MC manifestations was not homogeneous, and collaborative studies are clearly needed, particularly to optimise the therapeutic protocols.";<1997
473;Quinolinic acid in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and neuropsychiatric manifestations.;1996;The Journal of rheumatology;Vogelgesang SA;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between quinolinic acid, a neuroactive metabolite of L-tryptophan, and neuropsychiatric manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Forty specimens of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained from 39 patients with SLE who were evaluated for 40 episodes of neuropsychiatric dysfunction. The diagnosis of the neuropsychiatric dysfunction was determined clinically. CSF and serum specimens were analyzed for levels of quinolinic acid without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Neuropsychiatric dysfunction attributed to SLE (NPSLE) was confirmed in 30 patient-episodes (Group 1), whereas in the other 10 (Group 2) other etiologies were felt to explain their CNS dysfunction. The median levels of CSF quinolinic acid for Group 1 (232.5 nmol/l) were significantly higher than those for Group 2  (median 38.2 nmol/l) (p < 0.014). CSF and serum quinolinic acid levels correlated significantly (p < 0.003) but there was not correlation between CSF quinolinic acid and CSF protein concentrations or white blood cell counts. CONCLUSION: We conclude that elevated quinolinic acid levels in the CSF and serum may be associated with NPSLE and could possibly play a role in its pathogenesis.;<1997
474;Sensorineural hearing disorders in systemic lupus erythematosus. A controlled study.;1995;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Andonopoulos AP;"OBJECTIVE: Hearing abnormalities have been described in several connective tissue diseases, but relevant data in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is very insufficient. We therefore prospectively evaluated forty unselected consecutive female SLE patients for evidence of audiovestibular dysfunction and compared the  results with those of 65 age-matched healthy women. METHODS: Patients and controls were separated into five age groups, i.e. 16-29 years, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59 and 60-69 years. Evaluation included pure tone audiometry thresholds at octave frequencies from 125Hz to 8000Hz, tympanometry and the stapedial reflex test in both ears. In particular, SLE activity, the presence of vasculitis and severe kidney and nervous system involvement, and serum levels of anti-ds-DNA antibodies and C3 and C4 were recorded. RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease in hearing acuity at low frequencies (125-500Hz) was found in the patients aged 16-59 compared with the controls, whereas in the first group of young patients (16-29) a similar decrease was observed in the high frequencies as well. No correlation was found between these abnormalities and any parameter of the underlying disease. CONCLUSION: With regard to the high frequencies, our results suggest that young SLE patients exhibit a ""premature aging"" of the inner  ear which eventually stabilizes. On the contrary, at low frequencies there is a regular decrease in acuity in all groups (except for the elderly patients: 60-69), which may indicate a subclinical vestibular hydrops. This could be accounted for by an autoimmune process in the inner ear, quite possible in SLE.";<1997
475;Prevention of relapses in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1995;Lancet;Bootsma H;Many relapses of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are preceded by a rise in antibodies against double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA). We investigated whether these relapses can be prevented by giving prednisone when a rise in anti-dsDNA occurs. 156 patients with SLE were studied. Anti-dsDNA was measured by Farr assay monthly. When a rise in anti-dsDNA was found, patients were randomly assigned either conventional treatment or 30 mg prednisone added to the current daily dose and tapering off to baseline over 18 weeks. A rise in anti-dsDNA was detected in  46 patients (24 assigned conventional treatment and 22 prednisolone). The relapse rate was higher in the conventional group than in the prednisolone group (20 vs 2, p < 0.001). Although rises in anti-dsDNA in the prednisone group were treated  with additional prednisone, the cumulative oral doses of prednisone in the two groups did not differ significantly (p = 0.025). 7 major relapses requiring additional cytotoxic immunosuppressive treatment occurred in the conventional group versus 2 in the prednisone group. Treatment with prednisone as soon as a significant rise in anti-dsDNA occurs prevents relapse in most cases, without increasing the cumulative dose of prednisdone given.;<1997
476;Danazol for systemic lupus erythematosus with refractory autoimmune thrombocytopenia or Evans' syndrome.;1995;The Journal of rheumatology;Cervera H;"OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of danazol for refractory autoimmune thrombocytopenia or Evans' syndrome complicating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: We studied 16 consecutive patients with SLE and corticosteroid refractory autoimmune thrombocytopenia; 3 patients had coexisting autoimmune hemolysis (Evans' syndrome). Five patients had undergone splenectomy. Danazol was commenced at 200 mg/day, and increased stepwise (maximum 1200 mg/day) until benefit or toxicity was observed. After remission the danazol dose was gradually  reduced to 200-400 mg/day. RESULTS: All 16 patients achieved a complete remission (platelet count >100 x 10(9)/l, hematocrit >39%) 2 months after starting danazol  (range 6 weeks-8 months). Remission persisted during continued danazol therapy (mean followup 18.2 months, range 2-49 months). One patient with Evans' syndrome  required discontinuation of danazol because of jaundice and biopsy proven minimal hepatic necrosis: hemolysis recurred after discontinuation of danazol.

477;A pilot study of zileuton, a novel selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1995;The Journal of rheumatology;Hackshaw KV;OBJECTIVE: This is a pilot study of zileuton, a selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Forty patients with SLE received zileuton 600 mg qid or placebo in an 8 week, randomized prospective, double blind trial. Disease activity was manifested largely by constitutional, articular, and skin manifestations with no evidence of active renal, cardiac, or  neurologic involvement. Concomitant administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatories, corticosteroids, or antimalarials was not permitted. Disease  activity was determined at baseline and at Days 15 and 57 by assessment of arthritis severity, the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM), investigator and  patient global ratings, hematologic indices, and serologic measures including autoantibody titers, complement levels, and interleukin 2 receptors (IL-2R). Total body sulfidopeptide leukotriene synthesis was measured by urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) concentrations. RESULTS: Overall SLAM (the primary measure  of efficacy in this study) was significantly improved with zileuton compared with placebo (-2.1 +/- 1.3, compared with an increase of 2.3 +/- 1.3 with placebo by Day 57, p = 0.048). Changes in individual SLAM subscores, arthritis severity, global ratings, and IL-2R levels compared with baseline did not achieve statistical significance, but were generally decreased from baseline with zileuton (indicating trends towards improvement) and increased from baseline with placebo (indicating trends towards clinical worsening). Urine LTE4 levels at Day  57 had increased from baseline in the placebo group (indicating worsening) and decreased in the zileuton group (indicating improvement). CONCLUSION: Selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibition may be beneficial in mild SLE. AD  - Department of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Columbus 43210-1228, USA.;<1997
478;Dietary treatment of hyperlipidemia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.;1995;The Journal of rheumatology;Hearth-Holmes M;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dietary therapy in the treatment of hyperlipidemia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Using the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines, we screened 89 patients with SLE for hyperlipidemia. Step 1 dietary therapy was instituted in 28 patients as recommended by the NCEP. Twenty-six patients failed Step 1 intervention and received Step 2 dietary therapy for an additional 3 months. Twenty-nine control patients with SLE were tested for hyperlipidemia. RESULTS: The 89 patients with SLE (94% women, 77% black) had a mean age of 37.2 years. Fasting values were total cholesterol (TC) 6.22 +/- 0.16 mmol/l (240.9 +/- 6.0 mg/dl), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 4.08 +/- 0.14 mmol/l, (157.6 +/- 5.3 mg/dl), high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) 1.37 +/- 0.08 mmol/l (53.0 +/- 3.1 mg/dl), and triglyceride (TG) 1.71 +/- 0.12 mmol/l, (151.9 +/- 10.6 mg/dl). The mean dose of  prednisone was 14.2 +/- 1.6 mg/day. Prednisone dose correlated with levels of TC  (p < 0.01) by linear regression. The 28 patients receiving Step 1 dietary intervention had TC 6.11 +/- 0.19 mmol/l (236.4 +/- 7.3 mg/dl), LDL-C 4.05 +/- 0.19 mmol/l (156.6 +/- 7.5 mg/dl), HDL-C 1.31 +/- 0.08 mmol/l (50.7 +/- 3.0 mg/dl), and TG 1.64 +/- 0.12 mmol/l (145.4 +/- 10.3 mg/dl). The 26 patients receiving Step 2 dietary intervention had TC 5.84 +/- 0.17 mmol/l (226.0 +/- 6.6  mg/dl), LDL-C 3.83 +/- 0.19 mmol/l (148.0 +/- 7.2 mg/dl), HDL-C 1.25 +/- 0.08 mmol/l (48.5 +/- 3.2 mg/dl), and TG 1.66 +/- 0.15 mmol/l (147.1 +/- 13.4 mg/dl).  The mean prednisone dose was 14.8 +/- 3.0 mg/day for both study groups. There was no significance between prednisone doses in all groups studied (p = 0.08). After  6 months of dietary therapy, there was a significant decrease in only the TC (p = 0.158). CONCLUSION: TC correlated directly with the prednisone dose. Six months of dietary intervention was required to significantly decrease the TC. Further management of hyperlipidemia will probably require drug intervention.;<1997
479;Effects of dietary modification and fish oil supplementation on dyslipoproteinemia in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus.;1995;The Journal of rheumatology;Ilowite NT;"OBJECTIVE: To determine if a program of dietary modification and fish oil supplementation is effective in treating the dyslipoproteinemia in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Prospective clinical trial where each patient serves as his/her own control. Twenty-four consecutive adolescents fulfilling SLE classification criteria were screened with fasting lipid profiles. Patients were identified as having dyslipoproteinemia of active disease or of corticosteroid therapy. Patients were treated for 6 weeks with dietary modification and if dyslipoproteinemia did not normalize with another 6 weeks of  dietary modification and fish oil supplementation. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (71%) had dyslipoproteinemia; 10 of active disease, 4 of steroid therapy; 3 with  a combined pattern. Eleven patients underwent dietary modification. There was a significant decrease in serum triglyceride concentrations (p < 0.05). Total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol did not change significantly. A further significant decline in serum  triglycerides was achieved with fish oil supplementation (p < 0.05). Five of the  11 patients who underwent treatment continued to have dyslipoproteinemia. CONCLUSION: Dyslipoproteinemia is common in pediatric SLE. Dietary modification and fish oil supplementation appear to be effective in improving serum lipid profiles, and blinded studies are warranted. a significant number of patients may require pharmacologic therapy for persistent dyslipoproteinemia to prevent complications of premature atherosclerosis.";<1997
480;The use of single photon emission computerized tomography in neuropsychiatric SLE: a pilot study.;1995;The Journal of rheumatology;Kovacs JA;"OBJECTIVE: To test the sensitivity of single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in detecting brain abnormalities in cases of definite active neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) in a blinded, prospective pilot study. METHODS: Fourteen patients fulfilling at least 4 of the American College of Rheumatology criteria for the classification of SLE plus positive serology manifested by either elevated DNA binding or decreased serum complement  and a recent neuropsychiatric event were evaluated with cerebral SPECT using hexa-methyl-propylene-amine-oxime labeled 99Tc. Secondary causes such as infection, uremia, hypertension, drugs, and metabolic abnormalities were excluded. Patients underwent brain scan and electroencephalogram (EEG) for comparison. When clinically indicated, CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and lumbar puncture were performed. RESULTS: SPECT scan abnormalities were noted in 12/14 patients and brain scan was abnormal in 12/14 patients. SPECT and brain scan were in accordance in 12/14 patients (11 patients  both positive and 1 both negative) and the combination of SPECT and brain scan yielded 13/14 positive results. In the 3 patients with headache, SPECT scan was negative in 2/3, despite positive EEG and one with a positive brain scan. The positive SPECT in the patient with headache showed an old cerebrovascular accident (CVA), which was confirmed by CT scan. The most consistent CT finding was cortical atrophy; however, SPECT identified a lesion in the occipital cortex  in a patient with seizure, and a lesion in the basal ganglia in a patient with ataxia. CONCLUSION: In clinically and serologically active NPSLE, SPECT is a sensitive diagnostic tool. When further stratifying NPSLE into focal (seizure, ataxia, CVA) and diffuse (headache, organic brain syndrome, psychosis), SPECT appeared to be sensitive for focal disease and for most diffuse manifestations, with the exception of headache. The high sensitivity of SPECT in patients with true, positive NPSLE merits further controlled studies in unselected patients with SLE.";<1997
481;Hind III genomic polymorphism of the C3b receptor (CR1) in patients with SLE: low erythrocyte CR1 expression is an acquired phenomenon.;1995;Immunology and cell biology;Kumar A;Expression of the human erythrocyte C3b receptor (CR1-CD35) and its Hind III RFLP was studied in a group of 37 patients with SLE, 15 consanguineous relatives of the patients and 48 healthy normal subjects. The CR1 number on erythrocytes was quantitated by ELISA using a mAb to CR1. Serum levels of complement proteins (C3, C4, C3d) and circulating immune complexes (CIC) were estimated simultaneously in  controls and relatives. The patients were followed up during the course of the treatment. The CR1/erythrocyte (CR1/E) in patients were found to be significantly low in comparison to controls. The gene frequencies for the alleles H and L (7.4  and 6.9 kb Hind III restriction fragments) in the patients were 0.75 and 0.25, respectively, which did not differ significantly from the controls (0.77 and 0.23 in normal subjects and 0.79 and 0.21 in consanguineous relatives of the patients). However, patients expressed fewer CR1/E within each genotype than their relatives and healthy subjects. CR/E was found to be stable in consecutive  samples in controls. In patients, the numbers varied between low and high during  the course of the treatment. The variation in the numbers was significantly correlated with C3d and CIC as well as with the severity of the disease. Our results suggest that low levels of CR1 on erythrocytes in SLE patients are required during the course of the disease and that the 6.9 kb restriction fragment does not play a role in causing susceptibility to the disease.;<1997
482;Efficacy of bromocriptine in an open label therapeutic trial for systemic lupus erythematosus.;1995;The Journal of rheumatology;McMurray RW;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of bromocriptine in suppressing active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a therapeutic trial. METHODS: We conducted  an open label investigation of bromocriptine treatment in 7 patients with active  non-life threatening SLE. Patients received bromocriptine daily during the treatment phase of 6 to 9 months and were followed for 5 months after bromocriptine was discontinued. Disease activity was assessed by determination of the SLE activity Measure (SLAM) and the Toronto SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). Serum prolactin concentrations and a battery of serologic and urine tests were obtained at baseline and at monthly intervals during and after bromocriptine treatment. RESULTS: Serum prolactin concentration was suppressed from (mean +/- SEM) 11.2 ng/ml +/- 1.9 to 3.1 ng/ml +/- 1.7 after 6 months of bromocriptine treatment. The mean pretreatment SLAM score was 11.3 +/- 0.9;6 months of bromocriptine treatment significantly decreased the mean SLAM score to  6.0 +/- 1.6 (p = 0.03 compared to pretreatment measure). The mean SLEDAI score decreased from 16.0 +/- 2.0 to 5.9 +/- 0.8 (p = 0.02) during the same period. Bromocriptine treatment was associated with transient suppression of anti-dsDNA,  and serum cholesterol was reduced significantly through the treatment period. After bromocriptine was discontinued, all patients had increased disease activity associated with rising serum prolactin concentrations. CONCLUSION: These findings justify controlled trials to study the efficacy of bromocriptine in treating patients with active SLE.

484;Significance of antibodies to cardiolipin in unselected patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: clinical and laboratory associations. The SLE Study Group.;1995;Rheumatology international;Sachse C;In a multicentre study anticardiolipin antibodies of the IgG and IgM isotypes were measured by a solid phase enzyme immunoassay in 368 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who were not selected on the basis of features of antiphospholipid syndrome. Clinical and laboratory associations of increased levels of anticardiolipin antibodies were evaluated. IgG and IgM antibodies to cardiolipin were documented in 224 (60.9%) and 128 (34.8%) patients, respectively. Regarding the symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome, elevated amounts of anticardiolipin IgG were significantly associated with spontaneous abortion (P < 0.001), thrombocytopenia (P < 0.01), livedo reticularis (P < 0.01)  and a positive direct Coombs test (P < 0.05), but not with thrombosis or central  nervous system diseases such as epilepsy and psychosis. IgM antibodies to cardiolipin were associated with a positive direct Coombs test (P < 0.01), but with no other symptom of antiphospholipid syndrome. The predictive values of anticardiolipin antibody determinations in unselected SLE patients were poor for  all features of antiphospholipid syndrome because of high proportions of false-positive and false-negative results. As for other manifestations of SLE, positive correlations between raised antibodies to double-stranded DNA and the occurrence of anticardiolipin antibodies of the IgG isotype were observed, and anticardiolipin IgM was negatively associated with nephritis.;<1997
485;Urinary C4 excretion in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1995;"Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry";Ueda Y;The fourth component of complement (C4) in urine was measured in 19 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Urinary C4 was detectable in all SLE patients using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. In 11 of 13 patients whose urinary C4 was serially measured, a decrease of urinary C4 was found in parallel with a decrease of disease activity of SLE. In the remaining 2 patients, the amount of C4 increased preceding a flare-up of the disease. The measurement of urinary C4 may be useful in evaluating the disease activity of SLE in individual patients and sometimes in predicting the flare-up of the disease. The specific hemolytic activity of excreted C4 and Western blotting analysis showed that urinary C4 consisted mainly of degraded fragments of C4. In two cases, camostat, a serine protease inhibitor, rapidly decreased the urinary C4 excretion, suggesting that the complement activation occurred in the glomerulus in lupus nephritis.;<1997

Results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.;1995;Arthritis and rheumatism;van Vollenhoven RF;OBJECTIVE: To determine if dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is beneficial in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, 28 female patients with mild to moderate SLE were given DHEA 200 mg/day or placebo for 3 months. Outcomes included the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, patient's and physician's overall assessments of disease activity, and concurrent corticosteroid dosages (which were adjusted as clinically indicated). RESULTS: In the patients who were receiving DHEA, the SLEDAI score, patient's and physician's overall assessment of disease activity, and concurrent prednisone dosage decreased, while in the patients taking placebo, small increases were seen. The difference in patient's assessment between the groups was statistically significant (P = 0.022, adjusted). Lupus flares occurred more frequently in the placebo group (P = 0.053). Mild acne was a frequent side effect of DHEA. CONCLUSION: DHEA may be useful as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of mild to moderate SLE.

487;Five-year follow-up study of the prevalence and progression of pulmonary hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1995;American heart journal;Winslow TM;"The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and progression of pulmonary hypertension over a 5-year follow-up period in 28 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who were originally enrolled in an echocardiographic study of pulmonary hypertension in 1985 and 1986. Twenty healthy volunteers without cardiac or pulmonary disease participated as normal controls. Each patient and control underwent a complete Doppler echocardiographic study. Doppler echocardiographic recordings of tricuspid insufficiency, with saline contrast enhancement when necessary, were used to calculate pulmonary artery systolic pressure according to the modified Bernoulli equation. Doppler echocardiographic measurement of cardiac output was performed at rest for each subject, and pulmonary resistance was calculated by dividing the pulmonary artery systolic pressure by the cardiac output. These results were compared to results of the original studies to detect serial changes in pulmonary pressure and pulmonary resistance; results were also compared to the group of normal controls. The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension increased from 14% at the first study to 43% at follow-up. A significant increase in mean systolic pulmonary artery pressure was detected in the SLE patients during the follow-up period: 23.4 vs 27.5 mm Hg (p < 0.005).

Over the last 5 years a European multicenter study was carried out in order to reach a consensus on the definition of SLE activity. A new index, ECLAM (European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement), was created and then validated in the first and in the second parts of the study, respectively. In addition, a comparison between ECLAM and the other most commonly used lupus activity indices was performed. ECLAM appeared to be the best activity index for  classifying lupus patients, whether used as a single state index (i.e., to measure activity at a given moment in time) or as a transition index.

490;Beneficial effect of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids in the management of systemic lupus erythematosus and its relationship to the cytokine network.;1994;Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids;Das UN;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterised by arthritis, cutaneous rash, vasculitis, and involvement of central nervous system, renal and cardiopulmonary manifestations. Abnormalities in the cytokine network is believed to be involved in the pathobiology of this condition. The n-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can suppress T-cell proliferation and the production of interleukin-1, interleukin-2, and tumor necrosis factor by these cells both in vitro and in vivo. Oral supplementation of EPA and DHA induced prolonged remission of SLE in 10 consecutive patients without any side-effects.

METHODS: Ten women who had not been taking corticosteroids for at least 6 months were selected from a referral-based lupus clinic to participate in an N of 1 double-blind, controlled trial consisting of 3 randomly assigned drug/placebo pairings, with a  drug dose of 0.5 mg/kg of prednisone daily. RESULTS: Analysis of variance on the  group data yielded significant positive drug effects for cognition (P = 0.02), mood (P = 0.003), and SLE symptom ratings (P = 0.0002). Drug efficacy was also evaluated by an objective decision rule, which yielded evidence of overall drug benefit in 5 of the 8 patients who completed the trial, and a deleterious drug effect in 1 patient. Posttrial clinical results indicated that for the 8 women who completed the trial, ""acceptable"" decisions, leading to remission of SLE symptoms or appropriate withholding of steroids, were made on the basis of this rule. CONCLUSION: Improvement in cognition, mood, and/or SLE symptom ratings can  be observed following brief exposure to relatively low doses of corticosteroids in individual women with mild SLE; these persist over repeated drug exposure. The current application of N of 1 methodology represents the first systematic study of steroid efficacy in central nervous system (CNS)-related problems in SLE.

Possibly, therapeutic results can be improved by means of a ""synchronized"" combination of plasmaphereses followed by pulse cyclophosphamide (Ctx). If the hypothesis is correct, that plasmapheresis induces a compensatory ""rebound"" proliferation of pathogenic clones, then pulse Ctx applied immediately after plasmapheresis should attack these activated clones when they are most vulnerable and, ideally, eliminate them.

In this study we test the hypothesis that intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg), administered over a long period, would also be effective  in patients with chronically active SLE. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: An open trial was carried out on 12 patients with SLE refractory to conventional treatments, administering monthly infusions of intravenous immunoglobulins at a dose of 400 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days. The therapy (400 mg/kg for 5 days) lasted from  6 up to 24 months. RESULTS: Progressive clinical improvement was observed in 11 patients during the entire treatment course. This improvement was associated with an increase in hemoglobin, total serum hemolytic complement activity and C3 and C4 components, and in 2 thrombocytopenic patients in the platelet count, as well  as a progressive reduction of ESR, serum immunocomplexes and antinuclear antibodies. A marked improvement in serum urea, creatinine clearance and proteinuria was also observed in those patients with renal involvement. We did not observe any adverse effects.

495;Clinical course of cognitive dysfunction in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1994;The Journal of rheumatology;Hanly JG;OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate changes in cognitive function in a cohort of unselected patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and controls over a 12 month period. METHODS: Seventy female patients with SLE, 25 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 23 healthy subjects (age and sex matched) were evaluated using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and the National Adult Reading Test-Revised to identify impairment in 8 areas of  cognitive function. Cumulative disease manifestations and current medications were documented, and disease activity was expressed using the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI). Decision rules were determined for overall cognitive impairment. RESULTS: At baseline, 21% (15/70) of patients with SLE were impaired  compared to 4% (1/25) of patients with RA and 4% (1/23) of healthy subjects (p =  0.042). After a mean interval of 12.8 months (range: 11-17) 84% (59/70) of patients with SLE, 44% (11/25) of patients with RA and 80% (17/23) of healthy subjects were reassessed. This included all subjects who were impaired at the initial assessment. Using the same decision rules as at baseline, 12% (7/59) of patients with SLE were impaired at followup compared to none of the patients with RA and healthy subjects. Over the period of study cognitive impairment persisted  in 3 patients with SLE, resolved in 12 and evolved in 4 others. There was no apparent association between changes in cognitive function and concurrent changes in generalized disease activity, overt neuropsychiatric disease or corticosteroid medication. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that cognitive dysfunction in patients with SLE is evanescent, does not necessarily lead to irreversible neurologic compromise and changes independently of other clinical variables.;<1997
496;Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus with lobenzarit: an open clinical trial.;1994;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Hirohata S;An open clinical trial was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of lobenzarit (CCA), a newly developed disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug, in combination with conventional treatment with prednisolone for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Fifteen patients with SLE were given CCA 40 mg b.i.d. for the first 2 weeks, 80 mg b.i.d. for the next 4 weeks, and 80 mg t.i.d. or b.i.d. until the end of the 12-month trial, in addition to prednisolone, whose doses were kept unchanged throughout the trial. The patients' clinical responses to CCA, including alterations in various laboratory parameters and the development of complications, were evaluated at the end of 12 months. Fourteen of the 15 patients completed the 12-month trial. Significant increases in the white blood cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio, as well as decreases in serum anti-DNA antibody, were noted after the trial. Five patients presented with adverse effects, including mild liver dysfunction, gastrointestinal symptoms and  dizziness. Only one patient who developed dizziness withdrew at 9 months. Eleven  patients could be reevaluated after discontinuation of CCA, and only 2 of them have experienced recurrence of active disease 6 months after discontinuation. In  one additional patient who had not responded to prednisolone 35 mg daily, administration of CCA resulted in improvement of the disease activity. These results indicate that CCA in combination with corticosteroids is a useful adjunct in the treatment of SLE. A placebo-controlled study will be necessary to confirm  these results.;<1997

The patients were divided into two subgroups according to the following two criteria: (a) stable or flare stage according to clinical features; or (b) positive or negative results of chest X-ray. The GUI values of the subgroups were also compared. The results revealed a trend towards higher values of GUI in SLE patients than in the normal controls. The GUI values were also higher for SLE cases with a flare stage or a negative chest X-ray than in SLE cases with a stable stage or a positive chest X-ray.

Two patients with nephrotic syndrome treated with high-dose corticosteroids died from opportunistic infections. Fetal loss correlated with a  history of proteinuria and absence of anti-SSA antibodies. Prematurity was related to a history of fetal loss, active lupus at pregnancy onset, hypertension and > or = 20 mg/day prednisone during pregnancy. Intrauterine growth retardation correlated with pregnancy of short duration, low serum C3 or C4, hypertension, and absence of SSA antibodies. Three of 22 newborns whose mothers had anti-SSA antibodies developed neonatal lupus: two with cutaneous involvement and one with  complete atrioventricular block.;<1997
500;Unfavorable outcomes (end-stage renal failure/death) in childhood onset systemic  lupus erythematosus. A multicenter study in Paris and its environs.;1994;Clinical and experimental rheumatology;Levy M;Thirty of 118 cases of childhood onset systemic lupus erythematosus collected in  the Parisian area had an unfavorable outcome. Thirteen patients evolved to end-stage renal failure. Seven survived with renal substitution therapy, and 6 other patients subsequently died. Most had diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, the pattern of glomerular disease classically responsible for end-stage renal failure. Three patients had membranous nephropathy with segmental lesions, a form of glomerulonephritis whose severe prognosis should be emphasized. In another patient, end-stage renal failure was precipitated by thrombotic microangiopathy. Seventeen other patients died and in most, the causes of death were multiple. In 7, death could be attributed to complications secondary to an infection and in 4 other cases to SLE exacerbation with severe organ involvement. Two patients died suddenly, another showed cardiac failure and another had malignant hypertension. Of the remaining 2 patients, one suffered anticoagulant therapy complications after treatment for renal artery stenosis and the second, an urothelial carcinoma. Unfavorable evolutions were high among patients coming from French departments and territories, and among North African  patients. One may speculate that poor outcome is associated with ethnic characteristics or with socioeconomic factors. However, the problem of compliance with treatment is clearly an extremely important factor in the prognosis. Both end-stage renal failure and death were in some of our cases precipitated by treatment interruption, indicating an insufficient understanding of the importance of treatment in this chronic disease.;<1997

502;A pilot study of anti-CD5 ricin A chain immunoconjugate in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1994;The Journal of rheumatology;Stafford FJ;"OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and clinical and biological effects of a murine monoclonal anti-CD5 ricin A chain immunoconjugate (CD5 Plus) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: An open label phase I study of  CD5 Plus. A dose of 0.1 mg/kg was administered intravenously on 5 consecutive days. A second course of immunoconjugate was given to patients who failed to show any clinical response one to 2 months later. RESULTS: Six patients (4 with glomerulonephritis and 2 with thrombocytopenia) were studied. Improvement was documented in 2 patients with nephritis; no effect on thrombocytopenia was observed. Adverse effects were mild and transient. Relative to pretreatment lymphocyte counts, the mean reduction in CD3+ T cell count was 69% at 2 weeks, 32% at one month, and 34% at 6 months following initial treatment. A comparable decrease in all subpopulations of mature T cells was noted, using a variety of surface markers, including CD4 and CD8. The mean percentage of T cells expressing the activation markers HLA-DR and interleukin 2R (IL-2R) was high before treatment, and remained so. There was a transient decrease in CD5+ B cells, but no persistent depletion of total B cell numbers. There was no consistent change in natural killer cell populations. CONCLUSION: Anti-CD5 ricin A chain immunoconjugate is well tolerated in patients with SLE, causes modest T cell depletion which may persist for months, and may have some clinical efficacy in lupus nephritis.";<1997
503;Effect of low-dose cyclosporin A on systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity.;1994;Arthritis and rheumatism;Tokuda M;"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of low-dose cyclosporin A (CSA) treatment on disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: All patients in  the study had active disease as defined by at least the presence of a low CH50 level. Patients were initially given 3 mg/kg/day of CSA. Dosages were adjusted individually at every visit, according to both clinical and laboratory data. RESULTS: Eleven women with SLE were enrolled in the study; 10 were evaluable. After 20 weeks of CSA treatment, the mean score for disease activity on the SLE Disease Activity Index decreased significantly, from 10.6 to 3.8 (P = 0.02). The  titer of antinuclear antibodies decreased in 8 patients and the level of anti-DNA antibodies decreased in 5. Side effects included hypertension (40%), hypertrichosis (30%), gingival hypertrophy (10%), and a rise in the blood urea nitrogen level. Serum creatinine levels remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: The favorable responses observed in our patients strongly suggest that low-dose CSA can reduce the disease activity of SLE.";<1997
504;An open study of dehydroepiandrosterone in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1994;Arthritis and rheumatism;van Vollenhoven RF;OBJECTIVE: To determine if dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has clinical benefits in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Ten female patients with mild to moderate SLE and various disease manifestations were given DHEA (200 mg/day orally) for 3-6 months. The patients were given other medications as clinically indicated, and followed with respect to overall disease activity and specific outcome parameters. RESULTS: After 3-6 months of DHEA treatment, indices for overall SLE activity including the SLEDAI (SLE Disease Activity Index) score  and physician's overall assessment were improved, and corticosteroid requirements were decreased. Of 3 patients with significant proteinuria, 2 showed marked and 1 modest reductions in protein excretion. DHEA was well tolerated, the only frequently noted side effect being mild acneiform dermatitis. CONCLUSION: DHEA shows promise as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of mild to moderate SLE. Further studies of DHEA in the treatment of SLE are warranted.;<1997
505;Comparison of hydroxychloroquine and placebo in the treatment of the arthropathy  of mild systemic lupus erythematosus.;1994;The Journal of rheumatology;Williams HJ;OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and placebo (Pl) in the treatment of the articular complaints of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Seventy-one patients with mild SLE requiring  < or = 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent daily and with arthritis or arthralgias  were entered into a 48-week prospective, controlled, double blind multicenter trial and randomly assigned to either HCQ or Pl. RESULTS: Both HCQ and Pl were well tolerated in the 48-week trial. There were no remissions. With the exception of the patient assessment of joint pain, all other joint measures were similar between the groups. Twenty-nine patients withdrew before the end of the trial although only 2 patients withdrew for adverse drug effects. CONCLUSION: Our study found subjective pain relief as the only statistically significant difference in  joint count variables from HCQ in the treatment of the articular manifestations of SLE.;<1997
506;A 2 year, open ended trial of methotrexate in systemic lupus erythematosus.;1994;The Journal of rheumatology;Wilson K;OBJECTIVE: To investigate a possible role for methotrexate (MTX) in the treatment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who require unacceptably high doses of glucocorticosteroids (GCS) for control of their disease. METHODS: Twelve patients with SLE participated in this open ended prospective study. Patients with active renal or central nervous system (CNS) disease were excluded as were patients with liver disease. Serological variables, SLE disease activity index, joint count, and prednisone dose were serially evaluated. Data were analyzed using paired t test and contingency table analysis. RESULTS: Arthritis was the major persistent problem in 7 patients: 1 patient had recurrent pleuropericarditis, 2 patients had refractory cutaneous lupus rashes and 2 had vasculitis. Three patients discontinued MTX because of side effects. The remaining 9 patients have been treated from 7-26 months. In 6 patients the GCS dose was reduced by an average of 42%. In 1 patient symptoms subsided and joint count was reduced without change in the GCS dose. GCS dosage was increased in 2 patients: 1 with recurrent serositis, 1 with persistent vasculitis. No apparent effect on anti-dsDNA antibodies, complement or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was noted. CONCLUSION: MTX appears to be useful in selected patients with SLE, especially those with persistent synovitis.;<1997
